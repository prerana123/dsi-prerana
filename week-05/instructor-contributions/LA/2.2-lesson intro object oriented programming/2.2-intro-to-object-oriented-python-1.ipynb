    "Fundamentally, everything is an object of some **type**.  A class is a type of object and it is the basis of object oriented programming.  Object oriented programming is a vast topic and can be a very useful tool when used correctly.  Knowing how to use object oriented Python is esential to knowing the ins and outs of Python in general but the basics will help you understand how many built-in Python features behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a type in Python, that is similar to a function.  A class can have these features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data\n",
    "- Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, we try to group these items together in some logical manner, for a specific purpose.  Perhaps we want to bug Kiefer and keep track of how many times we might do that so we don't annoy him too much.  A class can help us organize a set of functions, and data that can be shared between each of the functions.\n",
