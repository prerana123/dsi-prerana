Run logistic regression with SKLearn using pipelines. Tune your model.

## Introduction

In this lab you will combine the feature extraction pipeline that you created in the previous lab with an estimator in order to generate a classification prediction.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

1. Build Pipeline
2. Train the model
3. Evaluate the model accuracy
4. Improve the model
5. Assess the tuned model

**Bonus**
- Experiment with other scoring functions

#### Starter code
