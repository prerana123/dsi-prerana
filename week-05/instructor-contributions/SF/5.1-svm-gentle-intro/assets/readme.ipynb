    "## Introduction: Support Vector Machines (45 mins)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Support vector machine is a binary linear classifier whose decision boundary is explicitly constructed to minimize generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall:\n",
    "- binary classifier – solves two-class problem\n",
    "- linear classifier – creates linear decision boundary (in 2d)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is derived using geometric reasoning (as opposed to the algebraic reasoning we’ve used to derive other classifiers). The generalization error is equated with the geometric concept of margin, which is the region along the decision boundary that is free of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![margin](./images/Margin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of an SVM is to create the linear decision boundary with the largest margin. This is commonly called the _maximum margin hyperplane_ (MMH).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear applications of SVM rely on an implicit (nonlinear) mapping that sends vectors from the original feature space K into a higher-dimensional feature space K’. Nonlinear classification in K is then obtained by creating a linear decision boundary in K’. In practice, this involves no computations in the higher dimensional space, thanks to what is called the _kernel trick_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary (MMH) is derived by the discriminant function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = w^T x + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where `w` is the weight vector and `b` is the bias. The sign of `f(x)` determines the (binary) class label of a record `x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![mmh](./images/mmh.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we said before, SVM solves for the decision boundary that minimizes generalization error, or equivalently, that has the maximum margin. These are equivalent since using the mmh as the decision boundary minimizes the probability that a small perturbation in the position of a point produces a classification error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the `MMH` is a straightforward exercise in analytic geometry (we won’t go through the details here). In particular, this task reduces to the optimization of the following convex objective function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{minimize:  } \\space \\frac{1}{2}||w||^2$$\n",
    "$$\\text{subject to:  } y_i(w^T x_i + b) \\geq 1 \\text{  for  } i = 1,..,N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the margin depends only on a subset of the training data; namely, those points that are nearest to the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These points are called the _support vectors_. The other points (far from the decision boundary) don’t affect the construction of the `MMH` at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation only works if the two classes are linearly separable, so that we can indeed find a margin to separate them. Usually however, classes are not separable, and there is partial overlap between them. This requires an extension of the formulation to accommodate for class overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft margin, slack variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Class overlap is achieved by relaxing the minimization problem or softening the margin. This amounts to solving the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{minimize:  } \\space \\frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^N \\xi_i $$\n",
    "$$ \\text{subject to:  } y_i(w^T x_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_j \\text{  for  } i = 1,..,N \\text{  and  } \\xi_i > 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyper-parameter `C`(soft-margin constant) controls the overall complexity by specifying penalty for training error. This is yet another example of Regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![soft margin](./images/soft_margin.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinear SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "The soft-margin optimization problem can be rewritten as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{maximize:  } \\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i\n",
    "   - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^N y_i y_j \\alpha_i \\alpha_j x^Tx$$\n",
    "$$ \\text{subject to:  } \\sum_{i=1} y_i \\alpha_i = 0, 0 \\leq \\alpha_i \\leq C $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the feature vector $x$ only appears in the inner product, we can replace this inner product with a more general function that has the same type of output as the inner product. This is called _kernel trick_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we can think of the inner product as a map that sends two vectors in the feature space K into the real line $R$. A kernel function is a non-linear map the sends two vectors in a higher-dimensional feature space K’ into the real line $R$.\n",
    "\n",
