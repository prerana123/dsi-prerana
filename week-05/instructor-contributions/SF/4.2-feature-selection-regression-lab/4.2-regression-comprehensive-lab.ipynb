    "\n",
    "You have been exploring feature selection, regularization, and evaluation metrics with classification this week (and last week).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's time to return to a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will be working with a dataset on **reservoir levels in California**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains these columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    id : the reservoir string id\n",
    "    date : the string date of measurement\n",
    "    month : the month of measurement\n",
    "    year : the year of measurement\n",
    "    reservoir_volume : the current volume of the reservoir\n",
    "    dam : the dam that supplies water to the reservoir\n",
    "    lake : a lake associated with the reservoir\n",
    "    stream : a stream associated with the reservoir\n",
    "    capacity : the total capacity of the reservoir\n",
    "    elevation : the string for elevation of the reservoir\n",
    "    river_basin : string code for basin of the river associated with the reservoir\n",
    "    county : the string county code that the reservoir is in\n",
    "    hydrologic_area : another location string identifier\n",
    "    nearby_city : the city that the reservoir is located near\n",
    "    latitude : the exact latitude of the reservoir\n",
    "    longitude : the exact longitude of the reservoir\n",
    "    operator : the governmental organization that manages the reservoir\n",

    "### Goal of the lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your primary goal is to **predict reservoir levels in 2015 using data from prior years**. Your primary evaluation metric will be **RMSE**, but feel free to try/use others as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have learned may useful skills to tackle this!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data munging/cleaning**\n",
    "- **EDA**\n",
    "- **Feature engineering**\n",
    "- **Feature selection**\n",
    "- **Regularization/gridsearching**\n",
    "- **Cross-validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use whatever you can to get the best predictive power! Godspeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### I WILL BE DOING THE LAB AT THE SAME TIME\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are competing with me in this lab to get a better RMSE.**\n",
    "\n",
    "YES, YES, I know it's \"unfair\" or whatever. However, I will be sharing my progress on my screen as I go through, so you have an advantage in that sense, since you can see what I'm doing as I go.\n",
