    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will explore several datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).\n",
    "We will also sharpen our tools creating some useful functions that wrap common machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assets folder contains several datasets (in order of complexity):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Breast cancer\n",
    "- Spambase\n",
    "- car evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these a `.names` file is provided with details on the origin of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Work in pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Instructor notes:**\n",
    "This lab builds gradually on several datasets. Each dataset should take max 25-30 minutes to analyze. If a pair is struggling, feel free to show them part or all of the solution to allow them to advance to the next dataset."

    "- model training (SVM)\n",
