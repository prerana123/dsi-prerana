> Note: This lab is a bonus/optional component for Week 5. Feel free to swap this out for additional review & project work as needed.

## Introduction

In this lab we will explore several datasets from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).
We will also sharpen our tools by creating some useful functions that wrap common machine learning tasks.

The assets folder contains several datasets (in order of complexity):

- Breast cancer
- Spambase
- Car evaluation

For each of these a `.names` file is provided with details on the origin of data.

In this lab you'll be working in pairs.

> **Instructor notes:**
This lab builds gradually on several datasets. Each dataset should take max 25-30 minutes to analyze. If a pair is struggling, feel free to show them part or all of the solution to allow them to advance to the next dataset.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

For each dataset, you'll be guided through a few steps, including:
- Feature extraction
- Model training (SVM)
- Accuracy evaluation
- Learning curves

In addition, you will learn to streamline your analysis by building wrapper functions around common steps.

**Bonus:**

The mushroom dataset contains some trickier aspects of data cleaning and preparation. It also contains a lot more features. There is also a bonus if you finish working on the others. Can you tackle it?
