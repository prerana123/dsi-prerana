## Introduction

This lab demonstrates your knowledge and understanding of kNN classifications on a dataset using Python syntax and the kNN functions in scikit-learn.

## Exercise

Using the [wine quality dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/wine.csv), build a kNN classifier to predict whether wines are high or low quality.

- Determine what relevant features might determine whether a wine is high or low quality.
- Build a feature matrix and target variable with the relevant predictive variables and scale the dataset appropriately.
- Build a KNN model to predict the target (high_quality) variable and evaluate the model's accuracy
- Determine the best k-value by looping through a range

#### Requirements

- Develop a Python program to perform kNN Classification on the dataset
- Tune the kNN model by finding the optimal K value

#### Starter code
- Python [Starter Code](./code/starter-code/starter-code.ipynb)

> [Solution code is here!](./code/solution-code/solution-code.ipynb)

#### Deliverable

- Outline Python program to perform kNN Classification
- Create a writeup on the interpretation of findings
