## Introduction

This lab demonstrates your knowledge and understanding of kNN classifications on a dataset using Python syntax and the kNN functions library.

## Exercise

Using the [wine quality dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/wine.csv), build a kNN classifier on ‘density’, ‘sulphates’, and ‘residual sugar’ features, with ‘high quality’ as target.

- Determine the best k-value by looping through a range
- Plot the results of your analysis

#### Requirements

- Develop a Python program to perform kNN Classification on the dataset
- Tune the kNN model by finding the optimal K value

BONUS:
- Run Logistic Regression on the dataset
- Tune Logistic model with regularization

#### Starter code
- Python [Starter Code](./code/starter-code/week4-2.4-starter.ipynb)

> [Solution code is here!](./code/solution-code/week4-2.4-solution.ipynb)

#### Deliverable

- Program to perform kNN Classification, iteratively searching for the best k

BONUS:
- Create a short writeup interpreting your findings
- Build a logistic regression model
- Compare your models with an ROC chart and/or AUC score
