First, here's your partner for this morning:

## Pairs:

```bash
('Michael', 'Katty')

('Sam', 'Lydia')

('Peter', 'Tucker')

('Tim', 'Kelly')

('Rebecca', 'Tamara')

('Phillippa', 'Hudson')
```

## More webscraping

We're going to practice scraping a website using Beautiful Soup. Start with the [webpage for a randomly chosen movie](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jurassicpark.htm) on Box Office Mojo. Use Beautiful Soup to get the movie's title, domestic total gross, distributor, and MPAA rating.

Then, generalize your scraping function to pull the same data from a list of movies. [There's a table of the top 100 movies for 1993](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1993&p=.htm). You can scrape that table to generate a list of URLs. Use the code you wrote for one movie to get the same information out of each URL.
