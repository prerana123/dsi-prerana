Depending on your perspective, you might guess metrosexual. He wears trendy jeans and a looped scarf; he keeps his beard tidy. On the New York City subway, he looks like any other typical 45-year-old man.\n\nUntil he opens his mouth. \n\nThorpe has a gay-sounding voice. In his case, that means a relatively high vocal register for a man and a hint of a gravelly creak you might expect from a Kardashian. He draws out some vowels with a melodic swing. \n\nSee also: 9 Gay Leaders Making a Difference in Technology\n\nBut it's only in the past three years, while working on his documentary Do I Sound Gay?, that he's fully embraced his \"gay voice.\" The goal of the film is to de-stigmatize the term, and eliminate the stereotypes and homophobia surrounding the distinct vocal style. \n\n\"There's nothing wrong with being gay, so there's nothing wrong with sounding gay,\" Thorpe tells Mashable. \n\nThorpe and his team are looking for a final round of funding for their project, via Kickstarter. They hope to raise $115,000 total by the end of May. At the time of writing, the documentary has reached $36,149. Thorpe has logged 165 interviews in four countries, targeting speech therapists, linguistics professors, gay men, straight men and celebrities such as Tim Gunn, David Sedaris and George Takei, who discuss anxieties with their own gay voices. \n\n \n\nWhen asked how he convinced so many prominent celebs to participate, he laughed, \"I had a really elaborate strategy: I asked.\"\n\nBeyond new civil rights for the LGBT community, whether it's same-sex marriage or revamped workplace-discrimination policies, the general public is more comfortable than ever with gay and lesbian people. Since 2001, American acceptance of gay and lesbian sex is up 19% to 59%, according to a 2013 Gallup poll. A majority of Americans support allowing same-sex couples to marry (53%), compared with 41% who oppose. And among western nations, the U.S. is considered on the low end in its overall acceptance of homosexuality (60%, compared to Spain's 88% acceptance).\n\nNow that we've tackled big-picture policy, Thorpe says, we're free to talk about many other aspects of homophobia that weren't possible before. \n\n\"Your anxiety about your voice can be the last vestige of internalized homophobia,\" he says. \"As you come out, you have to shed your own prejudices that society teaches you: that gay is bad. Your voice is so much the essence of who you are, an expression of your soul, that it can be one of the harder things to let go of. Every time you speak, potentially you're saying, 'I'm gay.'\"\n\nBut what is a \"gay voice?\" Ron Smyth, a semi-retired associate linguistics professor at University of Toronto Scarborough, has been studying gay and lesbian speech patterns since the late '90s. Early on, he and his colleagues ruled out the possibility that gay voice is a dialect -- in other words, the similar speech of a cohesive group of people who live in the same region, which evolves over time. That's not a good explanation for why some people sound gay, while others don\u2019t.\n\nSmyth says a man's gay voice can most reliably be traced back to one of two origins. First, men with gay-sounding voices were more likely to have participated in female-oriented behaviors, or to relate with female role models as they grew, sometimes developing more feminine mannerisms simultaneously. \"Whatever the cultural norms are for women in any language in the world or any dialect, there's going to be a gay-sounding voice that goes with it,\" he says.\n\nStill, correlations between these behaviors and sounding gay were much stronger correlations between sounding gay and being gay, which explains why many straight men sound gay.\n\nSecond, affiliation with other gay men (Smyth calls it \"community of practice\") may contribute to developing a gay voice, typically later in life. \n\nOver the years, with four separate studies that included both gay and straight participants, Smyth found very few reliable patterns in voice that correlate to being gay or straight. For example, there's no way to reliably predict who speaks deeply and who speaks with a hissy \"S\" sound most commonly associated with gay voice. Even among gay men only, there's little overlap. \n\n\"If you average all the butch guys and fem guys, it's all in the mess in the middle,\" Smyth tells Mashable. \"When we look at the correlation between sounding gay and being gay, it's always very low significance or none at all,\" (around +0.05 correlation).\n\nThe wild card: what third-party participants perceived as gay voice versus straight voice. Smyth asked people to rate 25 recorded voices on a scale of one to seven, with seven being the \"most gay-sounding.\" He found they were wrong much of the time. People labeled men gay who sexually identified as straight, and vice versa. \n\nHowever, the perception results were nearly identical: They agreed on who sounded gay or straight. And the ones who sounded gay (even if they weren\u2019t) did tend to have those gay-voice features, such as the hissy \"S.\" \n\nBottom line: People agree on what sounds gay. People agree on what sounds straight. But there's little accuracy in determining who actually is gay.\n\nStraight men experience similar anxieties as actual gay men about their gay-sounding voices. \"'I hate my voice. I sound so gay, and there's nothing I can do about it,' and 'I wish I could sound straighter, but I can't,'\" Smyth remembers many participants revealing. \n\nIt's a topic Thorpe addresses in his documentary: Men's fear -- no matter their sexuality -- that their voices betray aspects of themselves that society deems shameful. \n\nBut how did these stereotypes become so ingrained in society in the first place? To start, Thorpe points to the \"dandy,\" a fey, fashionable pop-culture icon of the early 20th century, with a voice often portrayed as aristocratic and snobbish. \n\nLater, public figures such as Liberace, Paul Lynde and Charles Nelson Riley charged 1970s and 1980s Hollywood with new perceptions of homosexuality, despite being questioned about their own sexual orientations, mostly due to their voices and mannerisms.\n\nIn the past five to 10 years, reality TV has done a remarkable service for gay voice, Thorpe says. Men such as Carson Kressley of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Tim Gunn of Project Runway have used their gay voices openly, making them relatable to mass audiences. \n\n\"America loves men who sound gay,\" he says. \"There's something very celebratory and compelling about it \u2026 We're getting back into another golden era of sounding gay.\"\n\nHowever, other representations in Hollywood make Thorpe cringe. Immediately, he cites Disney. Remember the villains Jafar from Aladdin and Scar from The Lion King? They're textbook definitions of \"aristocratic, fey pansies,\" Thorpe says, referring to the way Scar (voiced by actor Jeremy Irons) draws out the vowels in the word \"awful.\" \n\n\"This gay manner and way of speaking isn't lost on gay men in the audience,\" Thorpe says. \n\nDisney coupled the characters' voices with coy references to homosexuality in the script itself:\n\nScar: As far as brute strength is concerned, I'm in the shallow end of the gene pool.\r\nZazu [aside, to Mufasa]: There's one in every family, sire. Two in my family, actually.\n\n\"It's so obviously coded as gay,\" he adds.\n\nRegardless of some calculated Hollywood representations, Thorpe still wants people to talk about, and debate gay voice. Even straight people. When asked whether it's acceptable for straight people to use the term \"gay voice\" at all, he replied with an emphatic \"Yes!\"\n\n\"I think it is absolutely okay to say, 'My friend Bob sounds gay,' even if Bob isn't gay, because there's nothing wrong with being gay, so to say someone sounds gay is perfectly cool, too,\" he says, as long as it's not meant offensively. \"What we want to change is the idea that saying something 'sounds gay' is an insult.\"\n\nIn the end, anxiety around gay voice reflects the pressure everyone feels trying to conform to an ideal, he says. \"It's a symbol of the strength it takes to be yourself every day in society.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he's self-conscious about his voice while talking during the interview, Thorpe responds, \"I'm not. After three years of confronting my demons and talking to people about sounding gay, I'm so proud to be talking to you, and feel free about my voice.\"\n\n Have something to add to this story?

On the Ukrainian side, \u201cour losses were one killed, five wounded,\u201d he added. \n\nSee also: Photos: Face-to-Face With Ukraine's Pro-Russian Separatists\n\nMariupol online news portal and Reuters, however, have conflicting numbers. The outlets are reporting that two and three people were shot dead and at least eight more were wounded during a fierce gun battle.\n\nAvakov said the clash began after some 60 rebels with automatic weapons attacked the city police headquarters in an attempt to seize the building \u201cwithout any preliminary demands.\u201d The building has changed hands several times in recent days. Following the two-hour gun battle, the building went up in flames.\n\nSeveral witnesses, including journalists, also reported seeing pools of blood in the streets and at least one body lying outside the police building. \n\nWARNING: Graphic. Video from #Mariupol shows one man bleeding on the ground, possibly dead http://t.co/tdp50iCLGg http://t.co/u4xtdjP3Xb\u2014 Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) May 9, 2014\n\nRussian state news agency RT reported that one of its videographers at the scene was shot in the stomach and was being treated in an area hospital. \n\nAccording to Interfax, a pro-Russian rebel who took part in the shootout said Ukrainian forces used heavy guns to shell the building. His statement was corroborated by several other witnesses who said the Ukrainian forces used high-powered guns mounted atop their armored vehicles to suppress the rebel fighters who have besieged the industrial city of about a half-million people. They said some of those wounded during the skirmish were civilians.\n\nOne video apparently shows a Ukrainian officer firing a rocket-propelled grenade at the rebel-held police building.\n\nOleg Liashko, Ukraine's Radical Party leader and a presidential candidate who was in Mariupol at the time, wrote on Facebook that the Kremlin-backed rebels used automatic weapons and grenades against the Ukrainian forces. Several local police who he called \u201ctraitors\u201d after defecting to the pro-Russian side also took part in the shootout, he said. \n\nThe politician also said the rebels kidnapped Mariupol police chief Valeriy Androshchuk during the shootout. Androshchuk, Liashko said, was taken by \u201cterrorists\u201d from the \u201cburning police station in a car that was cut off by a sports utility vehicle.\"\n\n\"The fighters stabbed the jeep driver with a knife and placed Androshchuk inside the car trunk and drove off in an unknown direction,\u201d he added.\n\nThe central government in Kiev has not released an official report of the event, and police could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nPro-Russian separatists rally Victory Day crowds ahead of Sunday's referendum\n\nThe shootout is merely the latest in a string of gun battles that have occurred in Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions over the course of several weeks, leaving several dead. \n\nPro-Russian rebels and their supporters here have seized more than 20 key government buildings in at least 11 cities in the regions. They hope to vote in a referendum on Sunday, which is supposed to separate them from Ukraine\u2019s central government in Kiev.\n\nThe violence occurred as communists, war veterans and pro-Russian groups gathered in cities across the former Soviet Union to celebrate the 69th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s capitulation to the Soviet Red Army during the Great Patriotic War (as World World II is known here). The patriotic holiday, commonly known as Victory Day, is celebrated every year with large parades and rallies.\n\nIn the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, several thousand people turned out to at war memorials and outside the pro-Russian separatist-held regional government building to commemorate the day. War veterans marched in uniforms festooned with shimmering medals of valor as others waved the flags of Russia, the Soviet Union and the so-called \u201cDonetsk People's Republic,\u201d the self-proclaimed state that will hold a referendum on independence from Kiev on Sunday.\n\nPeople cheered and sang war hymns trumpeted from speakers mounted atop barricades wrapped in razor wire at the regional government headquarters, which the separatists have controlled for weeks, before the group marched to central Lenin Square.\n\nDuring the march, pro-Russian rebel-appointed governor of the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d Denis Pushilin, told Mashable that Friday would not only be a day to celebrate the Red Army\u2019s victory over the Nazis, but to rally citizens in support of the May 11 referendum.\n\n\u201cThere will be a referendum the day after tomorrow. And there will be a good result,\u201d Pushilin said.\n\nThe pro-Russian separatists here decided on Thursday to go ahead with the referendum as planned despite Putin\u2019s call this week to push it back. The vote is supposed to decide the future of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. But the central government in Kiev does not recognize the self-proclaimed \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic,\u201d has called the referendum a farce and said it will have no legitimate power, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn Sevastopol, the Black Sea port city of some 300,000 in the southern Crimean region annexed by Russia in March, it was a dual celebration. Following a massive parade that included several thousand soldiers at Moscow\u2019s Red Square, Russian President Vladimir Putin flew to Crimea to observe a large-scale navy parade in an apparent move to boast of Russia\u2019s victory in bringing the peninsula into the Kremlin's fold.\n\nShortly after Putin's visit to Crimea, the Ukrainian government condemned the Russian president, calling his visit \"unauthorized\" in a statement:\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine expresses the strongest protest against today\u2019s unauthorised visit by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, temporally occupied by Russia.\n\nUkraine considers this step to be a blatant disrespect by the Russian side for the legislation of Ukraine, international law; gross violation of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly Resolution \"On Territorial Integrity of Ukraine \", as well as the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between Ukraine and the Russian Federation of 1997.\n\nThis provocation makes yet another clear evidence that Russia has been consciously escalating tensions in Ukrainian-Russian relations and unwilling to bring bilateral disputes to diplomatic solution.\n\nWe demand the Russian side to return to the civilized way of international relations, listen to the decisive voice of international community, as well as repeal all the illegal acts on occupation and annexation of the part of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

How can a strategy ridiculed by critics, media watchers and even President Barack Obama have spurred a TV ratings and digital traffic spike for the network?\n\nBecause the audience told them it would.\n\nNowThis News poked fun at CNN's ongoing coverage of the missing plane.\n\nData from three different analytics systems, combined with overnight TV ratings, told CNN to double down on the missing airliner. The intense coverage paid off.\n\n\"I think that if people want to be critical of CNN for over-covering a story, that's totally fine with us,\" CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker told Mashable. \"Clearly, the audience has spoken and said that what CNN did was correct.\"\n\nCNN's use of data to track the habits of consumers online and on TV helped the outlet realize that the plane story had legs. That research prompted the network to keep the story on air longer than might seem intuitive to a news producer.\n\nAbout 18 months after taking the top job, Zucker has transformed the editorial side of the network and its online properties. The newsroom, once split between digital and television, is now more cohesive. Popular, apolitical celebrities like Anthony Bourdain and Morgan Spurlock have shows in spots once occupied by more traditional news programs. CNN is, on the surface, a very different network than it was a few years ago.\n\nThat change is not only skin deep. The company most synonymous with news has embraced data to help understand not just what to say and how to say it, but where to say it and when to stop saying it.\n\nThe result has been a deluge of plane coverage, a spike in television ratings and online traffic, and concern about the direction of \"the most trusted name in news.\"\n\nThe numbers game\n\nMH370 went missing on the morning of March 8, Malaysian Standard Time -- Friday evening on the East Coast of the U.S.\r\nMalaysia Airlines says it has lost contact with a flight carrying 227 passengers en route to Beijing. http://t.co/xFJqzF9rJP\n\n\u2014 CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) March 8, 2014\n\nCNN first reported the story around 8 p.m. ET, and mobile page views and video views both shot up more than 150%. Other analytics highlighted that the story outperformed other articles in the same spot on CNN's homepage.\n\nA big story driving traffic isn't surprising; CNN is known to perform better during periods of breaking news, but this was different.\n\nIn the following days, the story continued to build. CNN's data showed that people had not grown tired of the story -- they wanted more. That led CNN to dedicate more resources, attention and time to the story.\n\nCNN's ratings in 2014 had been slightly lower than in 2013, until the MH370 story broke. In the chart below, the red line represents 2014 ratings -- note the significant boost in March during the plane coverage, followed by a gentle taper. The yellow line represents 2013 -- the Boston Marathon bombings in April of that year sent CNN's ratings soaring, a testament to what big breaking news can do for the network.\n\nKC Estenson, general manager of CNN Digital, said the missing Malaysian airliner was just the most visible example of the network's embrace of data as an editorial tool.\n\n\"We're looking at consumption patterns and trends across the web, mobile, social and video, and then on third-party sites, looking at that and making decisions about how we program for all platforms,\" said Estenson, who oversees CNN's data operations. \"You're seeing that start to come online and start to bear fruit with something like the Malaysian airline story.\"\n\nData now informs nearly every part of CNN's editorial decisions.\n\nDataminr combs Twitter to help journalists find stories as they happen. Outbrain is employed to analyze real-time mobile consumption and Chartbeat to monitor how each story performs. Content is tested with Optimizely. Moat will soon map the performances of stories on CNN sites in real time as well as help with ad serving. Omniture, an Adobe-owned analytics company, is also in the mix.\n\nCNN's data operations began before Zucker arrived but became an area of emphasis after he started. The two met to discuss CNN's digital future before Zucker actually took the job, Estenson said.\n\nThese tools are not exclusive to CNN, but it weaves them together into a potent combination that is pushing the network to test the limits of what it covers and how. Editorial judgment is now augmented with a deeper understanding of what the audience wants.\n\n\"That data we're bringing in online is now also helping to embolden Jeff [Zucker] to tell the TV producers 'stay with this story,'\" Estenson said.\n\nEverybody's a critic\n\nCNN's coverage puts the network in a difficult spot. Embracing data and pushing the MH370 story beyond conventional limits has helped the company reap television rating and online traffic bumps. But the success has been accompanied by a chorus of detractors, some ridiculing the coverage and others questioning the editorial decision making.\n\nJon Stewart on \"The Daily Show,\" former CNN host Larry King and plenty of others have lined up to lampoon or lambaste the outlet. Few have been as brutal as TIME's Joe Klein, who said CNN has \"gone in the toilet.\"\n\nThe collective reaction of CNN executives: Numbers, not critics, are the measure of success.\n\nThe network is purposefully moving to fulfill viewer wishes, and that might mean more MH370 coverage going forward.\n\n\"Our job is to take the biggest stories of the day and report them and synthesize them and analyze them for the audience,\" said Andrew Morse, an SVP at CNN who heads up newsgathering. \"We'll continue to do that and again the audience has clearly been interested in the disappearance of the Malaysian plane.\"\n\nThe people's channel\n\nThe internal changes combined with the shakeup in CNN's primetime lineup have left some analysts wondering just what the channel is. The first 24-hour news network no longer shows news 24/7.\n\nCNN has shifted its primetime lineup to more narrative, documentary-style programming. An evening once packed with the news of the day now features personalities like Mike Rowe, who \"visits unique individuals and joins them in their respective undertakings,\" and John Walsh, who covers international criminal investigations.\n\n\"We are a place where people come for breaking news all the time, but we also recognize that news doesn't break all the time,\" Zucker said. \"What we're trying to do is provide other information and different types of storytelling.\"\n\nOther channels that previously produced this type of content have moved more toward reality and competition programming, Zucker said. Combine that with the shift of news consumption toward digital -- particularly toward mobile -- and CNN believes its new programming puts it in a position to fill a gap.\n\nThat gap is markedly different from the one CNN filled when it launched in 1980.\n\n\"It's obvious that CNN has gone from a place of being among the most serious and the only, at one point, 24-hour news network to one that is very noticeable chasing after audience and putting its news judgment sometimes in the backseat,\" said Liz Spayd, editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review.\n\nA 25-year veteran and former managing editor of The Washington Post, Spayd said the emergence of analytics in digital media had given consumers a much-needed voice in journalism. From the editor's chair, she cautioned, the temptation to chase the numbers can be strong.\n\n\"Like with most things in life you have to do it in balance. I think what's disturbing to people is when you see a news organization that seems to have almost lost their purpose, that has lost the reason to be in that market place to begin with. I'm not saying CNN is at that point, but I think they're being watched in that way.\"\n\nThere are some indications that the short-term advantages of catering to viewers come at a cost. A Pew Research Center study found that one in three people thought CNN's coverage of MH370 has been excessive, although about half said it was the correct amount.\u00a0YouGov, a brand-tracking firm, found that public perception of CNN dipped slightly after three weeks of coverage. The success is also short-lived. Television ratings that rose right after the disappearance of MH370 have returned to previous levels.\n\nAnd what of the vaunted CNN brand that many believe CNN is destroying? The business community sees things differently than the media critics. CNN's changes are regarded as a shrewd move to update an old model.\n\nJosh Feldmeth, CEO of brand management firm Interbrand New York, said CNN was positioning itself well with modern consumers.\n\n\"We're seeing the brand enter what we call the 'age of you,' which is the expectation that the brand is fully customizable, personalizable and revolves around their needs and wants,\" Feldmeth said.\n\nReputation also matters with advertisers. Jack Myers, chairman of MyersBizNet, a cooperative of media companies, agencies and marketers, said CNN's stock has risen as Zucker's strategy has taken shape.\n\n\"The advertising community has a more open and positive attitude toward CNN today than they've had in quite a while,\" Myers said.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

She did everything her doctors told her to do: chemotherapy, double mastectomy and radiation, and eventually went into remission. We were so grateful, and thought the nightmare was over. \n\nIn November 2009, exactly two years after her initial diagnosis, it was discovered that the cancer was back and had metastasized throughout her lymph nodes, bones, lungs and later on to her liver and a spot in her brain. \n\nIt seemed like an impossible fight, but she fought harder than I even knew was possible. She did countless hours of research on cancer and how it works at a cellular level. She changed her diet dramatically, going from a 'meat and potatoes' Midwestern diet full of processed foods and sugar to a predominately vegan and organic diet. She took up yoga and exercised with a personal trainer. She became fit and physically strong for the first time in her adult life. \n\nIt was around this time that I began to realize that my mom was so much more than 'just' my mom -- she was an extraordinarily strong, smart, tenacious person who wanted nothing more than to be with her family and friends as long as she could. \n\nMy mom did everything she could medically, holistically, mentally, spiritually and physically to stay here with us. I will never forget that. It gets me through those moments when I\u2019m missing her the most and asking, 'Why isn\u2019t she here?'\n\nShe wanted to be so, so badly. She moved mountains to stay. She looked death in the eye and said, 'Not yet.' And when the time came that she acknowledged that she could not win this battle, she had no fear. She told us she loved us, and kept telling us she loved us until her voice was gone. \n\nMy mom was the strongest, bravest person I\u2019ve ever encountered, and I can say with certainty that no one will ever inspire me the way she did.\" -- Kourtney Leibman, Shawnee, Kansas\r\nAmar Trivedi and his mother Prerana Trivedi\r\n\"My Mum's name is Prerana. It means 'Inspiration' in many Indian languages. She said she'd travel to New Zealand (for the first time all by herself, at age 73) to visit my wife Dee and I. \n\nWhen she arrived in Dec 2011, I remember jumping over the airport barricades and running to give her a hug. For that 50-day visit, I thank God for every day... We traveled and ate and talked and laughed and made so many fond memories \u2014 they're enough to last a lifetime.\" -- Amar Trivedi, New Zealand\r\nAnn Caren and her mother Katherine Mitchell\r\n\"On May 10, 2002, my daughter Madison was born. She was my parents' first grandchild ... A few days later, my father let me know that he was sick. Very sick. His cancer had returned and his circulation was so bad that the doctor's wouldn't do treatment. He was going to die from either the cancer or his heart. My parents kept this a secret during the last part of my pregnancy so as to not upset me.  \n\nTwo weeks after my daughter was born, my father died ... I can only imagine the heartbreak my mother experienced. However, it was also election day in my hometown, and coincidentally, my mother had already thrown her hat in the ring for a commissioner position, even before the dire realization of her near future.  \n\nShe wanted to be a part of something greater than herself. She wanted to help out her small town. She wanted to make a difference.  So in between the funeral, receiving mourners at her home and bonding with her new granddaughter, she not only voted for her say in the election, but SHE WON!!!!! \n\nMy mother has always taught me to be the bigger person, to have compassion for every person, to rise above and to above all, be my own source of strength. My mom never remarried, never dated, never even showed an interest. She has made her community, her friends and her family her life.\" -- Ann Caren, Kennesaw, Georgia\r\nAndrea Dom\u00ednguez and her mother\r\n\"Ever since I was a little girl, for my birthday I would get one special gift from my mom. She would let me choose that one, and it could be anything from candy to a headband or a meal at McDonald's. \n\nWhen I turned 15 (for my Quincea\u00f1era party), I chose a stuffed toy in the shape of a Mexican dressed cucumber (from VeggieTales) that sang a funny song. When my family saw my special gift, they all flipped, and she stood up for me and said, 'She gets to pick whatever she wants, and if she chooses to still be a kid, she will always be MY kid!'\n\nI'm 25 now and she still gets me candy, stuffed animals, sticker books, Disney movies and bakes a big purple cake with Skittles all over it.\n\nNot only [does] she inspire me ... That woman rocks my world!\" -- Andrea Dom\u00ednguez, Guatemala\r\nJamie Williams and his mother Lisa Williams\r\n\"When I was a child my mother was making my lunch one day when a fire erupted on the stove top. My brave mom ran into the kitchen, grabbed the flaming pot and ran outside with it. As if that wasn't heroic enough... after the flames were gone, my mom sat in a chair on our porch and told me to stay inside and not to worry. \n\nHer expression seemed a bit strange and she had her body turned away from me, but she was otherwise completely calm and collected. I later found out that she suffered third-degree burns from her elbow to her fingertips on her right arm. \n\nShe used every bit of strength and willpower she had to hold back tears and screams so that I wouldn't get scared or worried.\" -- Jamie Williams, Fort Myers, Florida\r\nAurora Bolivar and her mother Eleuteria Bolivar\r\n\"I am 32 now, a graduate of AB Communication.

It makes them anxious, obsessive and often unable to pick up social cues. It's Asperger's syndrome. \n\nAsperger's is a disorder on the autism spectrum. It gets its name from Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who first observed the condition in a group of children in 1944. Common characteristics include poor social skills, anxiety, average to above average intelligence and an intense focus on facts or hobbies, coupled with a penchant for rigidity and aversion to change.\n\nBut in today's pop culture, Asperger's cues make for ripe entertainment opportunities.\n\nSee also: 5 Autism Simulations to Help You Experience Sensory Overload\n\nAsperger's on the screen\n\nIn episode three of the new HBO series, Silicon Valley, the main character, nerdy programmer Richard Hendriks, gets sized up by a bullish man. \"You remind me of my son. He's got Asperger's, too,\" he says to Hendriks, who waffles nebbishly, stammering as he tries to explain his way out of the diagnosis. \n\n\"[The show] is like Asperger's Entourage,\" actor T.J. Miller, who plays the character Erlich on the show, previously told Mashable. \n\nThere's that word again. More and more, the term is becoming a go-to tick, a signal that a character will fall into certain characteristics: intelligent, quirky, awkward.\n\n\"Part of what seems to be happening with Asperger's now is that it\u2019s almost becoming shorthand, kind of the way OCD has,\" Erika Drezner, a coordinator for the Asperger's Association of New England, tells Mashable. \"It means they\u2019re nerdy and smart and not very socially gifted.\" Drezner is running a pop culture-themed workshop at an upcoming AANE conference, and is mother to a child with Asperger's.\n\nHowever, those with the syndrome vary greatly. They aren't all geniuses with social skills problems on the side. Far from it. According to Pat Schissel, executive director and president of the board of the Asperger Syndrome and High Functioning Autism Association, only about 12% of the Asperger's community is \"gifted\" in that sense.\n\nThus far, none of the main characters on Silicon Valley have actually said they have Asperger's. It's not the first time TV characters have outwardly displayed \"common traits\" of the syndrome, without actually owning the disorder. The Big Bang Theory, Community, The Middle and Bones are among the hush-hush crowd. The characters tap close to home, but never quite go there. In The Middle, it's suggested that the character Brick is on the autism spectrum by a teacher who says he is \"a quirky child...maybe clinically quirky, even.\" \n\nHowever, just because the condition goes unnamed doesn't mean the Asperger's community is blind to the references. But does it hurt the public's impression of the disorder, equally?\n\nKeeping it quiet\n\nReasons vary for the autism spectrum silence in Hollywood. Community creator Dan Harmon says it didn't occur to him that the character Abed might have Asperger's, until fans of the show started pointing it out. Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady has said the character Sheldon was based on someone he used to know, though the actor who plays Sheldon, Jim Parsons, has admitted, \"I can say that he couldn't display more facets of it.\" \n\nPlenty of YouTube clips exist, purely to document Sheldon's Asperger's-like behavior.\n\nNow that Sheldon has been pegged by the autism community, the writers squirrel even farther away from labeling the character. It would mean added responsibility to straddle the fine line between mockery and mirth. Definitively labeling a character with Asperger's requires a new layer of sensitivity.\n\nSilicon Valley is an especially loaded example, given pop culture's inclination to connect Asperger's with tech geeks. Take Lisbeth Salander, the tattooed misfit heroine of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo film series. She has remarkable intelligence, photographic memory and a penchant for computer hacking. Though author Stieg Larsson never explicitly writes that Lisbeth has the disorder, he communicates the possibility via thoughts from other characters, like protagonist Michael Blomkvist, who surmises she must have the syndrome.  \n\nThen there's The Social Network, the 2010 flick about the founding of Facebook. It paints Mark Zuckerberg as a narcissistic aspie. Though the character is, again, never labeled with the disorder (and the real Zuckerberg has never made any indication he has it), film reviews and autism sites were quick to point out the character's intense similarities, established from the film's opening scene, where Zuckerberg displays his poor social skills.\n\n\"I think the whole character portrayal of the Zuckerberg movie is a perfect example of people who think, \u2018Oh well, Asperger's, they\u2019re just arrogant and they want to be left alone and they\u2019re weird and that\u2019s it,'\" says Christian Tsetsos, mentor and administrative assistant at Behavioral Concepts. \"I think that a lot of us, especially me before I was socially competent, want so bad to connect -- we just don\u2019t know how.\"\n\nTsetsos, 25, was diagnosed with Asperger's when he was five years old. He describes his early years with the disorder as \"horrendous\" and anxiety-inducing, though he says he now has a better grasp on it. \n\n\"I lived socially isolated from the time I was 12 to 20. Basically, I would go to school, I\u2019d come home and that was my life,\" Tsetsos says. \"At 20 years old, I was wondering what it would be like to have a friend, so at work I decided to challenge myself to try to connect with the others.\"\n\nHe now considers himself socially aware, but what he sees on screen doesn't mirror his own experiences with Asperger's, he says.\n\n\"I think pop culture tends to focus on the more impaired, bizarre acting,\" he says, citing examples like the titular character of Adam, the 2009 film about a lonely man with a textbook definition of Asperger's.\n\nIn the comedy world, the unusual (especially if it's particularly bizarre) is welcomed with open arms. The more extreme aspects of Asperger's translate into wild onscreen antics, so long as the disorder itself remains unnamed. \n\nWhen it is named, it can tread dangerous waters. Season three of the hybrid musical dramedy Glee introduces a character named Sugar Motta. She quickly parades into rooms, making rude and socially unaware comments, but it's \"okay\" because she has \"self-diagnosed Asperger's.\" The show faced backlash around the trope-y character. \n\nWould critics direct the same negative reaction at Sheldon, if his character was labeled as openly?\n\nAsperger's, so long as it's unnamed, is an easy plot excuse to make characters perform quirky or bizarre acts, due to the disorder's wide-ranging behavioral traits.  Show writers who purposely don't give their characters disorders get away with most anything. Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory behaves strangely because he's just \"Sheldon-y,\" not because he's someone with a disorder.\n\n\"I think there\u2019s a general misunderstanding of how debilitating [Asperger's] can really be,\" Drezner says. \u201cI think the danger is when people sort of get one idea in their head and get kind of attached to it and say, 'This is what the condition is -- it\u2019s Sheldon.'\"\n\nThe aim for realism\n\nFictional works like Parenthood have aimed to portray Asperger's seriously. The NBC dramedy stars a large family, featuring a character named Max, who is diagnosed with Asperger's at a very young age. It comes from a personal place: The show's creator and executive producer Jason Katims has a son with the syndrome. The personal touch has made fans out of people in the community, such as Schissel and Drezner, who both name it one of their favorite portrayals of Asperger's. \n\n\u201cI feel like it can be comforting to see representations of your experience on TV,\" Drezner says. \"I think it's normal.\" \n\nAlong with Parenthood, Schissel and Drezner also commend The Middle. However, Tsetsos says he sees more of himself in introverted characters like Angela Chase of the short-lived series My So-Called Life (though she doesn't have Asperger's). \n\n\"She\u2019s not supposed to have a disorder, but I feel like a lot of us with Asperger's were kind of like that,\" Tsetsos says. \"We look normal, but we\u2019re just with our own struggles.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, it's more about how those with Asperger's can relate to the characters, regardless whether the disorder is explicitly there. For Tsetsos, it's more important that the public educates themselves, and not simply rely on the limitations of Hollywood. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

App.net's Developer Incentive Program, which was a way to compensate developers for building apps and services on top of App.net, is also winding down. Caldwell and Berg will remain responsible for operating App.net, but they'll no longer draw a salary for doing so.\n\nAlthough the blog entry announcing this change emphasized that \"App.net will continue to operate normally on an indefinite basis\" (emphasis theirs), no full-time employees and reduced developer incentives will make it difficult for the project to evolve and for the community to grow.\n\nAlready, members of the ADN (the colloquial term for App.net) community are starting to make plans to migrate to other services, and create lists of user names. Paradoxically, the service as it exists now still runs, and will probably have the budget to continue running for quite some time.\n\nIn essence, App.net has become a bit like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat -- both alive and dead at the same time. \n\nI've spent the last day thinking a lot about App.net, specifically its mission and trajectory. Like others, I'm not really surprised by the most recent ADN development, but that doesn't make it any less sad. Fundamentally, I still think many of the ideas and principles behind ADN are important and worth pursuing. I can't help but think this is going to be the sort of project that will be looked back on with reverence for what might have been.\n\nFrom an audacious proposal to crowdfunded success\n\nTo have a better understanding of why ADN didn't succeed the way many of us wanted it to, it's important to revisit the platform's origins. On July 1, 2012, developer and entrepreneur Dalton Caldwell posted an essay on his blog entitled, \"What Twitter could have been.\"\n\nThe essay was written at a time when Twitter was making changes to its API and transitioning from a more outward-facing, developer-friendly company to something much more insular. Caldwell's lament was that the Twitter from the early days, where its API enabled a slew of new features, clients and use cases for the service, was disappearing. (It's worth noting that many of those third-party ideas were rolled in to Twitter proper, and had a significant role in making Twitter a multi-billion dollar company.) \n\nThe response to that post, particularly in the developer and web communities was tremendous. As a result, two weeks later, Caldwell published another essay, this one entitled, \"Announcing an audacious proposal.\" \n\nCaldwell's proposal was the creation of a \"financially sustainable realtime feed API and service\" that wouldn't be incumbent on revenue goals, pressure from investors or a push toward advertising or mining user data. \n\nFortuitously, Caldwell was already working on the building blocks for such a platform. Before App.net became a social platform, it was a service for mobile-app developers. While working on App.net 1.0, Caldwell and much of the development team spent time building a secret project; that project would be the groundwork for Alpha, App.net's version of Twitter.\n\nConvinced that creating a sustainable, ad-free real-time feed API and service was more important than building a service targeted at mobile developers, Caldwell announced he would pivot App.net to serve as that product and platform. \n\nThe audacious part of Caldwell's proposal wasn't the idea itself; it was that Caldwell was asking for money to build such a service and platform. Using a Kickstarter-like campaign, Caldwell's goal was to raise at least $500,000 from around 10,000 backers. The idea was that if 10,000 people could be convinced to donate at least $50 for a year of access to this type of service and platform, it could reach the critical mass needed to build apps and tools that would make the project a success.\n\nThe crowdfunding page (archived, here) went up on July 13, 2012 with the requirement that it would only move forward if $500,000 was raised in 30 days.\n\nThe response from many in the development and web communities was mixed. Many appreciated the idea behind Caldwell's proposal, but didn't think it could raise $500,000 to do what it set out to do. Some fully embraced the concept, while others dismissed it on both principle and practicality.\n\nI fell in the first camp. I ponied up $100 in order to support the ideals of the project (and to reserve @christina as my username), but I didn't have any confidence that the project would actually raise $500,000, let alone become a viable alternative to something like Twitter. And to be clear, up until the last few days of the campaign, it didn't look like App.net would make its goal.\n\nBut App.net did manage to raise $500,000 in 30 days. In fact, it managed to raise over $750,000 from over 11,000 backers.\n\nIn the most perfect case of poetic timing I've ever seen, the App.net campaign coincided at a time when many developers in the Twitter ecosystem were very unsure about the future.\n\nThe siren call of a \"better\" Twitter was enticing. After all, developers had helped build Twitter in the first place -- why couldn't they do it again, but this time for a service that would be self-sustaining and ad-free?\n\nDefining App.net\n\nEven before the crowdfunding campaign was complete, Alpha, App.net's short-messaging system, was released to backers.\n\nFor good and for bad, Alpha would be what would define App.net in the eyes of the public. Alpha is very similar to Twitter in that it allows users to @message one another, include links to photos, videos or URLs and follow various accounts. \n\nAlpha also has a few advantages over Twitter, namely that the character limit is 256 and not 140, as well as more granular control over things such as mute filters and alerts. \n\nIt also had a rapidly-evolving API, which meant developers could start building apps for App.net right away. The early days of App.net were reminiscent of the early days of Twitter, when the service was largely populated by developers and early adopters. In 2007 and 2008, Twitter clients were a veritable playground for developers and users. So many features that are now just expected -- not just of Twitter, but any social network -- came directly out of those early experimentations. \n\nApp.net activity was robust, with new clients for iOS, Mac, Android and the web popping up daily. I was excited to see the community that was building up within and around App.net. For a moment, it was easy to imagine that App.net really could be a success.\n\nThe problem with Alpha, however, was that it was never intended to be the sole product of App.net. App.net was always supposed to be about a larger decentralized platform. Caldwell and others working on App.net were always very clear about the broader focus of the platform.\n\nIt was this focus, incidentally, that drew me to App.net in the first place. App.net's goal wasn't to have one app -- but hundreds. You could use the App.net APIs and tools to bring in information and data, and present it the way you wanted.\n\nAt the same time, a user could use App.net as a sort of traveling online identity that would contain not just their social graph, but data from other apps. For instance, a user could sign up for an App.net-powered photo service and follow some friends, take photos and apply filters. Now, let's say the user wants to sign up for a video service. When the user logs in with App.net, they can connect their existing social graph (all the users they already follow on the photo service), and also have access to all of their photos. The idea was for the user to control the social graph and cloud data, and just give apps access (or take access away).\n\nAlpha wasn't supposed to represent App.net, but to merely be an example of what could be build on it. \n\nHere's the problem: Two years later, that message was never properly delivered to the Internet at large. Even today, most people see App.net as another failed Twitter clone -- another Identi.ca. \n\nI also don't think the developer community necessarily caught on with App.net's grander vision -- or at least, not fast enough. The majority of apps built for App.net are Alpha clients. That's great in the early days of a project, but for a platform to truly be a platform, you have to have other types of successful apps and services. A Wired profile on App.net last August honed in on this problem.\n\nAt the time, Caldwell disputed that App.net had an identity problem or that the platform had become to associated with just one type of experience. \n\nLooking back, however, it's hard to argue against the notion that App.net didn't adequately define what it was to its users or its developers. \n\nI can't help but wonder if the identity problems would have persisted if a different type of app was chosen for Alpha. For instance, if Caldwell had recreated PicPlz -- the photo-sharing service he developed that went head-to-head with Instagram (and lost) -- the concept that App.net was a robust platform and not just a Twitter clone would have been better understood.\n\nPerhaps the App.net team should have pushed harder to release a Beta app or Gamma more quickly -- not necessarily as fully furnished products, but as examples and ideas -- in order to better control the messaging.\n\nOf course, all the messaging in the world couldn't solve App.net's other major problem: being a pay service.\n\nWill anyone pay money for a social network?\n\nOne of the core tenants around the philosophy of App.net was that users would not be the product. The service was ad-free and the API terms were very explicit about what could and could not be done with user data.\n\nFor years, I've heard friends and acquaintances exclaim that they would pay for a free service if it meant \"getting rid of this\" or \"letting me do that.\" Here's the cold, bitter truth: Getting people to pay when a free alternative exists is very, very difficult.\n\nUnlike most social platforms, App.net did not launch with a free tier. You had to pony up $50 or $100 for access to the service. The decision to not offer a free tier was deliberate. For one, Caldwell wanted to ensure that the project had the funding it needed to build out its infrastructure.\n\nAt the same time, Caldwell said he didn't want users to sign up without understanding the idea behind the platform, only to drop it like so many of us dropped Plurk, Identi.ca and every other social networking flavor of the week from the height of Web 2.0 mania (Chime.in, anyone?).\n\nThat was a solid strategy, but the downside was that it capped App.net's user base in the service's early stages. Sadly, it also meant that when most of the heavy buzz around App.net was taking place, the service was behind a paywall.\n\nInitially, it was almost freeing to be on a smaller social network. As time went on, however, the problem was that if I wanted to share something, I had to do it on both ADN and Twitter. ADN became yet another social channel for stuff, and because I had fewer friends on the system, it became less relevant in my life.\n\nBefore Tuesday, the last time I used ADN was in November. That's not because the service was bad or that the people aren't lovely -- but it's simply too difficult to maintain social identities on multiple platforms. Inertia was part of the problem, too, but I don't think I'm alone in saying that if ADN had managed to attract a larger swath of users, I would have had a better chance of shifting my social conversations to that platform.\n\nAnd when App.net did finally offer a free tier, there were caveats. First, a user had to get an invite to App.net (that has since changed, and anyone can sign up). Once signed up, free users were limited to following 40 users and having 500MB of cloud storage (paid users get 10GB). Paid accounts were set at $36 a year for regular users, and $100 for developers.\n\nI understand the need to limit features for a platform to be self-sustaining. Still, I think the cap on followers was a big mistake. To me, capping the follower count meant that most free users would simply dip a toe into ADN.\n\nInstead of limiting followers, perhaps it would have been better to limit the number of apps a free user could use. Or maybe the solution would be to give paid members more incentives -- special badges, extra features, early access to certain apps -- and keep the base service (sans cloud-storage credits) as is.\n\nGetting people to pay for any service is difficult, but it's extra difficult when the service doesn't have that many users to begin with. Because ADN was never able to reach critical mass -- and by that, I mean millions of users -- there was less of an incentive to pay for more features. \n\nIt also meant there was less of an incentive to develop apps. Although App.net offered developers revenue share for apps and clients built on the platform, I've spoken with creators of many great apps for App.net that had a hard time sustaining development.\n\nAs Brianna Wu noted on her blog, Bill Kunz, developer of the fantastic ADN client Felix had found it impossible to make money off of the app. That's a big problem when Felix is one of the best App.net apps for iOS because it's a prime indicator that the audience might just not be there for a network.\n\nI don't have the solution to the balance between growing users and maintaining financial stability -- I wish I did. But the primary reason App.net no longer has full-time employees is that not enough users paid for the service in order to make payroll.\n\nWhat could have been\n\nI feel guilty writing off App.net as dead, as the service is still running, and will for the foreseeable future. But it's clear that the original vision in that audacious proposal -- of a set of open standards that could be used to power social apps and real-time streams -- didn't pan out.\n\nThat's depressing for lots of reasons, mostly because it means the idealistic notion that the web won't be increasingly controlled by massive corporate entities is false.\n\nI'm also sad because of the unrealized, or unappreciated, talent within the App.net community. Three of my favorite App.net clients, Felix, Riposte and Whisper are just a sampling of what kind of skill was part of App.net.\n\nWhisper is one of my favorite examples that showed the promise of App.net. The app is a group-messaging app built off of ADN's private-messaging system. Like any other app of its kind, you can send photos, stickers, your location or even nearby places.\n\nYou can't do group messaging with Twitter. Twitter isn't even ideal for one-to-one chats (DM archives are kind of a pain). To me, Whisper is the perfect example of what was possible on App.net, but was invisible to most of the population.\n\nThe mission behind App.net was good. The rationale arguably makes more sense today than it did two years ago. The challenge is actually making something like ADN work, while also attracting a viable user base.\n\nDespite my cynical exterior, I'm a web idealist at heart. And although I don't think ADN will ever achieve its audacious vision, stranger things have happened. I mean, did anyone expect an 11-year-old events service sold to Yahoo, then killed off, to make a comeback? \n\nAs long as ADN's servers are still running in November, I'll renew my $100 subscription. Call it my donation to the indie web that almost was.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

It is expected to increase significantly and could become the largest tech IPO of all time. \n\nIf your first thought reading that is \"What the heck is Alibaba?\", you're probably not alone. \n\nAlibaba is a household name in China and well-known among certain tech industry watchers and investors abroad, but it doesn't exactly have mainstream recognition among consumers in the United States. That might change after its IPO.\n\nSee also: Chinese E-Commerce Giant Alibaba Files for $1 Billion U.S. IPO\n\nTo help you get a head start learning about this fast-growing tech company, we've put together a primer on what Alibaba does, how it got so big and what impact it might have on other U.S. businesses.\n\nWhat exactly is Alibaba?\n\nThe Alibaba Group is the largest ecommerce company in China and, according to some reports, the largest in the world. It primarily consists of two big shopping websites: Taobao, which launched in 2003 to compete with eBay in China, and Taobao Mall (or Tmall), an online shopping marketplace.\n\nSo basically it's just China's version of Amazon?\n\nNot quite. Unlike Amazon, Alibaba doesn't actually handle any of the logistics -- like fulfillment centers -- for online shopping. It just creates the platform and user experience for consumers to shop from various brands. \n\nEven that user experience is notably different. \"When you are buying something on Amazon, you are engaging with amazon,\" says Kelland Willis, an analyst with Forrester Research. \"When you buy on Tmall, you are engaging with the brand.\"\n\nAlibaba's investments also extend well beyond traditional ecommerce. It has invested in a Chinese department store operator, mobile messaging app Tango and Weibo, China's version of Twitter which recently went public. It is also reportedly in talks to get back a stake in Alipay, a payment service like PayPal.\n\nJust how big is it?\n\nAlibaba generated more than $3 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2013, an increase of 66% from the same quarter a year earlier. Its gross profits for the quarter shot up by an even higher percentage to just under $2.4 billion.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports hearing from sources that the combined sales volume on Taobao and Tmall hit $240 billion in 2013. On Single's Day, which is essentially China's version of Cyber Monday, Taobao and Tmall topped $5.75 billion in sales. That's more than double the sales of all online retailers on Cyber Monday. \n\nAlibaba is expected to go public with a market cap of around $165 billion, though some analysts think it may top $200 billion.\n\nHow does someone even build up a company that big?\n\nAlibaba was founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, an eccentric English teacher-turned-entrepreneur who became interested in building Internet companies after going online for the first time in 1995 while on a trip to Seattle. \n\nThe secret to Alibaba's success, according to Forrester's Willis, is a combination of launching when the ecommerce market was still small in China and going out of its way to build trust with consumers in the country.\n\n\"What Taobao did from the beginning was they created a set of regulations that absolutely ensured consumers get the product they ordered,\" Willis says. One example of that is the option to pay cash upon delivery, after the shopper has had a chance to inspect the item in person. \"It builds trust with the brand. As a result, consumers thought of Alibaba Group as a whole as one they could trust to interact with.\"\n\nChina's ecommerce market has also ballooned in recent years and is expected to be larger than that of the United States in the not-too-distant future.\n\nWhy is one of the largest companies in China doing a public offering in the U.S.?\n\nInitially, Alibaba reportedly wanted to go public on the Hong Kong stock exchange, but decided otherwise because regulators in the country would not greenlight its proposed governance structure. But Alibaba stands to gain other benefits from listing in the U.S. as well.\n\n\"By listing in the U.S. you open up the doors to a lot more potential investors,\" says R.J. Hottovy, senior analyst with Morningstar. \"There are some question marks about accounting and security rules outside the U.S. and European markets. The U.S. listing will add a layer of creditability.\"\n\nWill the Alibaba IPO have any impact on U.S. tech companies?\n\nThe Alibaba IPO is coming at a time when investor sentiment for the tech sector has weakened thanks in part to sky high valuations. That could change if Alibaba proves to be a strong IPO. \n\n\"If it was successful and did well and was priced with a premium valuation, I think that could have a halo effect on the broader tech space,\" Hottovy says. \"It could spur some renewed interest in the space.\" \n\nAt the very least, it will have a notable impact on Yahoo, which as a 24% stake in Alibaba and stands to net as much as $10 billion from the Alibaba IPO, depending on how it prices. That could give Yahoo and CEO Marissa Mayer the additional resources needed to make some big acquisitions.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

After shooting the guards, and setting fire to houses, the terrorists kidnapped nearly 300 of the girls and drove off into the woods.\n\nThat was on April 15. The girls haven't been heard from since. \n\nAnd the media, for the most part, has remained largely silent. Coverage of the missing girls has been dwarfed by the other major stories of late -- the South Korean ferry, the racist NBA owner and the missing Malaysia Airlines plane.\n\n\"Maybe if the more than 200 Nigerian girls abducted from their school weeks ago were on a ferry in Korea, a jet liner in the Indian Ocean, in the owner's box at a Clippers basketball game, or were white, the world would pay more attention,\" Boing Boing blogger Xeni Jardin said, echoing the thoughts of many.\n\n\"If it had happened anywhere else, this would be the world's biggest story,\" said CNN's Frida Ghitis.\n\nBut now, three weeks later, a hashtag associated with their disappearance has been tweeted nearly 1 million times. \n\nThere is a petition calling on the Nigerian government and all enabled international parties to rescue them, and more than 250,000 people have signed it. There are tumblr blogs, Facebook pages, and -- finally, some would say -- mainstream media coverage. \n\nBut getting to this point was no mere accident. It was the direct result of a semi-coordinated campaign to make world leaders, the media -- and you -- aware of the plight of Nigeria's missing girls.\n\nThe rise of #BringBackOurGirls\n\nMuch of the digital chatter around the girls is tied to a hashtag -- #BringBackOurGirls -- which is nearing its one-millionth mention on Twitter. \n\nTweets about \"#BringBackOurGirls\"\r\n!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");\n\nIts launch can be traced to an April 23 event honoring the Nigerian city of Port Harcourt, recently nominated as UNESCO's 2014 World Book Capital City (Bangkok previously held that title). \n\nThere, at the opening ceremonies, a former Nigerian government official and Vice President of the World Bank for Africa named Oby Ezekwesil spoke for the crowd in demanding the release of the school girls, saying, \"Bring back the girls!\" \n\n (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Post by Port Harcourt World Book Capital 2014.\n\nTwo men in attendance tweeted her remarks -- and included the hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters.\n\nYes #BringBackOurDaughters\n#BringBackOurGirls declared by @obyezeks and all people at Port Harcourt World Book Capital 2014.\u2014 Ibrahim M.

Please All, use the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls to keep the momentum UNTIL they are RESCUED.\u2014 oby ezekwesili (@obyezeks) April 23, 2014\n\nIt hummed along until April 30 when news broke that hundreds of the girls would likely be shared with Islamic militants as wives -- read: sex slaves -- or sold for $12 at local markets.\n\n\"We have heard from members of the forest community where they took the girls,\" one man told his family of the girls' fate. \"They said there had been mass marriages and the girls are being shared out as wives among the Boko Haram militants.\"\n\nAnd more:\n\nThe girl\u2019s father fainted, the Guardian reported, and has since been hospitalized. But the news got worse.

It was tweeted 268,616 times on May 1. In total, there have been 916,984 mentions of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls as of May 5. The one-millionth mention will likely come early this week.\n\nAnd since that day, celebrities, politicians and world leaders -- from Mary J.

Amnesty International has launched bringbackourgirls.tumblr.com, where they are asking people submit solidarity photos to tell the missing girls' families that \"our thoughts are with them and their daughters and sisters.\"\n\nCristina Finch, managing director for the women\u2019s human rights program at Amnesty International USA, tells Mashable they launched the tumblr to let the girls and their families know that they\u2019re not alone and that \"the world is watching, and cares and is trying to help free them.\u201d \n\nShe notes seeing a noticeable uptick in media coverage throughout the last week, due in part to all the social media bringing attention to the girls, whose kidnapping she calls \"a human rights violation of paramount importance.\"\n\n\"We want to continue to keep the press on and keep the visibility of what's happening there until there is a resolution of this issue and these women are released,\" Finch says.\n\nNigerian government vows to rescue the girls\n\nNigerian President Goodluck Jonathan addressed his nation on Sunday after three weeks of silence and said he would bring the girls home. \"Wherever these girls are, we\u2019ll get them out,\u201d he said on live television, asking for \u201cmaximum cooperation\u201d from parents.\n\nNigeria's Minister of Information Labaran Maku joined in with a press release that stated, \"The President assures Nigerians that \u2018wherever the girls are in the world, we will get them back, apprehend and punish the culprits.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelatives of the missing girls, however, claim the Nigerian government is not doing enough. \n\nThe president's wife, Patience Jonathan, had the leader of one protest arrested on Monday after a meeting concerning the missing girls. Others, meanwhile, staged a \"million-woman march\" in the capital city of Abuja calling on the Nigerian government to bring the girls home. Supporters, meanwhile, held rallies around the world -- in New York City's Union Square and outside London's Nigerian High Commission. \n\nJohn Kerry pledges assistance\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Saturday, John Kerry said the U.S. would support Nigeria's efforts to find the missing girls. \"Let me be clear,\" Kerry said. \"The kidnapping of hundreds of children by Boko Haram is an unconscionable crime, and we will do everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice.\"\n\nWhat is Boko Haram?\n\nBoko Haram is an Islamic militant group active in Africa whose name means \"Western education is sinful.\"\n\nThe group has been suspected for a causing string of recent attacks throughout Nigeria, including two bus bombings in April as well as mass murders of 30 schoolchildren in February and 50 in September.\n\nThe group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, claimed responsibility for the girls abduction in a video that surfaced on Monday, according to the AFP. \n\n\"Western education should end. Girls, you should go and get married,\" he said. \"I will repeat this: Western education should fold up. I abducted your girls.

Painted pipes and girders line the warehouse-like ceiling. Coworking areas and \"flex spaces\" scatter across the open floor plan. The small kitchen doubles as a printing area. Six large tables extend along the far wall, each with a whiteboard divider to scrawl new and exciting ideas.\n\nThe setup is conducive to a trendy, emerging startup's needs. But Beespace isn't a startup -- it's a nonprofit incubator that identifies and launches innovative organizations dedicated to social good. And like many companies looking for success in the digital age, it's taking cues from the tech startup world.\n\nSee also: 10 Amazing Google Earth and Maps Discoveries\n\nMarissa Sackler, founder and president of Beespace, says the office itself is a direct borrow from the startup scene -- it belonged to a friend's tech incubator before the company moved elsewhere in the city. A conversation with that same friend, in which Sackler aired her frustrations about working for early-stage nonprofits, spurred the idea for Beespace.\n\n\"I loved working with nonprofits, and I loved working in the social good space,\" she tells Mashable. \"[But] I had become frustrated with the feeling that a lot was being dropped in the follow-through, that [new nonprofits] didn't have the operational capacity to put a lot of their ideas into place, and that, therefore, they weren't able to achieve the scale they should have been able to. I felt there had to be a better, more comprehensive solution.\"\n\nSackler turned to the startup model for inspiration. She spent a year speaking with people in the tech world, the nonprofit world and everywhere in between to help flesh out the idea for a nonprofit incubator.\n\n\"From the very beginning, I knew I wanted to have this comprehensive feel, [for it] to be a three-pronged approach: the coworking space -- the importance of having these groups learning and working side-by-side; the broader community that I could bring -- mentorship aspects, our advisory board and our partnerships; and teaching best practices, allowing them to build the skills so that they can build out their operations and strengthen their programming,\" she says.\n\nBeespace now has three \"incubees,\" or fledgling nonprofits looking to build and expand their resources: the Malala Fund, the Adventure Project and Practice Makes Perfect. Beespace gives them the physical space to work, connects them to mentors, designers, engineers, accountants, fundraising strategists and PR specialists, and provides seminars and talks from speakers across the nonprofit space.\n\nSackler says they'll take up to six incubees at a time, each for a period of two years or until they reach six full-time staff members -- whichever comes first.\n\n\"We don't run their organizations for them,\" she explains. \"We're here to help them get the most out of their idea and their nonprofit. This is a great space for them to build their teams and to take risks -- to find an amazing new technology that no one else in the nonprofit sector is using and to see whether that helps them scale.\"\n\nSo Beespace not only adopts the startup model, but also strives to incorporate tech into the nonprofits' operations. Traditionally, the nonprofit world is very slow to adapt to new technologies, according to Sackler. When someone innovates, everyone tries to do the same thing until it becomes a very crowded space. Think, for example, about online donations several years ago -- how game-changing they were when nonprofits like charity: water introduced them into the fray -- compared to today.\n\n\"There isn't enough constant innovation. The space shouldn't have to be completely crowded and impossible to utilize in order for someone to take the next step. We want to see constant innovation in the same way that you see in the for-profit world, especially in the tech space,\" she says.\n\nTo Raheel Gauba, manager of Internet strategy at Blackbaud, a typical tech startup takes a single niche problem and attempts to solve it \u2014 \"nothing more, nothing less.\"\n\n\u201cIf you look at their No. 1 marketing vehicle -- the website  -- the user experience is designed with a very sharp focus on the industry challenge, how they are solving it, how others have benefited from their solution, and how you can participate,\" he says.\n\nNonprofits should streamline their websites in the same way, focusing primarily on quality of content, showcasing success stories and using compelling calls to action \u2014 \u201cmore than just a red button in the header.\u201d The key, Gauba explains, is to be top-of-mind in the audience\u2019s daily lives. \n\nThen there is the \"hip\" factor, he says. How a nonprofit presents itself online creates a powerful perception its operations and mission. \"Will I get quick tidbits of very useful, visual and engaging information, or will I get boring reports with tons of content to read?\" asks Gauba. \"As a busy professional on the go, I prefer the former versus the latter.\"\n\nThat \"hip factor\" can apply to more established organizations, too. Nancy Lublin, CEO of DoSomething.org, one of the largest nonprofits for teens and social change, shared similar frustrations with the nonprofit sector as Sackler.\n\nWhen she joined DoSomething in 2003, 10 years after it was founded, they had just fired 21 out of 22 people, there was $75,000 left in the bank, the organization was $250,000 in debt, and they had lost their office space.\n\n\"If you looked up 'f*cked company' in the dictionary, our logo would be there,\" Lublin says. \"[But] it was the year after Friendster, and the year before Facebook ... and one of the things I did was say, 'Look, there are faster, better and cheaper ways to reach young people now. We don't need to go through schools, ... print lots of curricula and ship them all over the country. It's called the Internet.'\"\n\nLublin suggested they shut down the local offices around the country, and she was almost fired for it. But she told the board to trust her. \"Betting on the Internet turned out to be a good move,\" she says.\n\nDoSomething currently has 50 full-time employees and 2.5 million members, and the team is on track to run 250 campaigns this year. (Last year, they ran 26.)\n\nUnder Lublin's leadership, DoSomething has borrowed a lot more from the tech startup model, proving that more established nonprofits can still make the shift. Lublin adopted her hiring rules from DJ Patil, who was the first chief data scientist at LinkedIn, and DoSomething is the only not-for-profit she knows that doesn't look at prospective employees' educational backgrounds -- a characteristic inspired by Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal, and the startup world in general.\n\n\"I want to say we've taken everything [from the for-profit world]. We tend to operate a lot more like tech startups. But to just say, 'Oh, I've hired lots of young people and we move fast and break things' -- that doesn't mean you're a tech startup,\" she says.\n\nAdapting to change is what's key. DoSomething's CTO is part of the management team, and one-third of the entire staff writes code. \"All of these people are used to building things that either break or are outdated in three to six months. So the very notion of change is familiar and comfortable to them,\" Lublin says.\n\nBack at Beespace, the notion of change is present. Now about six months into the incubation process at Beespace, the Adventure Project, which creates jobs in developing countries by partnering with local organizations, has already developed new practices and started executing fresh ideas.\n\nAdventure Project cofounder Becky Straw says she worked closely with Beespace's director of fundraising and engagement to launch the nonprofit's new web platform, which connects donors directly to the entrepreneurs they've supported. After a year, donors will receive the story of the individual they supported -- \"showcasing their impact in action.\"\n\n\"I am always looking at the tech sector for ideas and inspiration,\" Straw says. \"I believe now, more than ever, nonprofits need to run lean and constantly iterate. It\u2019s not enough to have a great product, but you have to know how to sell it, how to engage donors and design your organization for rapid scale. To reach our goals, we have to think like a tech company.\"\n\nWithin three months of starting at Beespace, the Adventure Project gained the same number of donors it took the team to collect during its entire previous fiscal year. All three incubees have made new hires, reworked their web designs and expanded their networks. \n\n\"We want to make sure that we're a part of their growth moving forward,\" Sackler says. \"We hope to have six great success stories. It will be really interesting to see the data -- what it looks like to track them through our space, and then beyond.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Shortly after departing with driver and translator in tow, Giglio confronted a Ukrainian army checkpoint and was waved through. They then encountered a pro-Russia militant checkpoint, whose militia members asked a few questions before letting them pass. Up next was a third checkpoint, this one a bit closer to the city. That's when they were told to pull over to the side of the road. \n\n\u201cThey basically didn\u2019t know what to do with us. Were they supposed to let journalists through or what?\u201d says Giglio of the pro-Russian men at the checkpoint. \u201cThey called their superiors, and after about 20, 30 minutes the militia guys came and said they would take us to local military headquarters.\u201d\n\nIt was not up for negotiation. \n\n\u2028Giglio and his crew had their flak jackets and helmets stolen by those manning the road and were taken to a local town where militants had occupied a government building. \n\nThat\u2019s when they met up with a group of 10 people \u2014 other kidnapped journalists and their staffs \u2014 who were piled into in a hijacked news organization\u2019s minibus with towels over their faces and masking tape around their heads.\n\nAmong them was CBS News\u2019s Clarissa Ward and reporters from Sky News. (Ward told her story to CBS This Morning.)\n\n\u201cThey drove us to a town called Horlivka, which they consider to be their military headquarters, to a local security building that they\u2019ve occupied,\u201d Giglio tells Mashable. \"The ride took about 45 mins or an hour because they were taking backroads and all these roundabout ways. They had to ask directions.\"\n\nEach time the van pulled up to another pro-Russia checkpoint, the journalists' kidnappers called ahead to gain permission to pass through, illustrating, Giglio says, that there is no clear line of command amongst the groups. \n\n\u201cAs we pulled up you could hear the guys cocking their guns,\u201d he says, \u201cso they are mutually suspicious. There\u2019s not very good coordination going on here.\u201d\n\nBlindfolded on drive to where pro-Russia militia held us, but heard them cock guns as we approached their own checkpoints--internal mistrust\u2014 Mike Giglio (@mike_giglio) May 2, 2014\n\nEventually, they arrived at their destination. \n\n\u201cThey brought us to this place and they kinda perp-walked us from the bus to the place where they held us,\u201d Giglio says. He describes the building as a concrete back building with a dirt floor that was more than likely used for storage. \n\n\"We had to put our hands on the wall and stand against the wall. One journalist started crying, saying, 'Don\u2019t hurt us.' And they yelled at us, roughed one guy up, and they took all of our belongings.\u201d \n\nIt was scary, Giglio says, but he noted how his kidnappers kept saying they would soon return his things, which he saw as a good sign. \u201cI don\u2019t think al Qaeda tells you you\u2019re going to get your wallet back,\u201d he says.\n\nThe kidnappers then conducted what Giglio calls a \u201cMickey Mouse interrogation\u201d in which they asked each journalist to name the capital of the country listed on their passports. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Michael?\u201d they asked him. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d\n\n\"USA,\" Giglio responded. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the capital?\" they asked. \"Washington,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen they made me pronounce, \u2018garden,\u2019\u201d Giglio says.\n\nTo prove that I am an American citizen I was asked to name the U.S. capital and then to pronounce the word \"garden.\" I passed this test.\u2014 Mike Giglio (@mike_giglio) May 2, 2014\n\nGiglio says he has no idea why they would ask him to say that word, but he figures, \u201cTrying to judge if my pronunciation was American?\u201d \n\nA woman interrogated the group \u2014 she was the only one there who spoke decent English \u2014 and had one captor beat up a British journalist who she didn\u2019t believe to be from London. \n\nA translator with the kidnapped journalists told them he overheard a conversation discussing keeping them as hostages. Giglio thought a likely scenario would be one in which they would keep them hostage and eventually try to negotiate an exchange.\n\nBut then, as they stood in the shack with its dirt floor among men with guns, the mood suddenly changed.\n\n\"At some point they decided they would let us go,\" Giglio says. \"They got apologetic, took our blindfolds off, gave us our stuff back, made us count our money to make sure if anything was missing, gave us tea \u2014 we had an awkward little tea party \u2014 and they came over and tried to explain what had happened.\"\n\nOnce they decided to release us -- and a translator overheard talk of taking us hostage -- the pro-Russia militiamen politely served us tea.\u2014 Mike Giglio (@mike_giglio) May 2, 2014\n\nWhat happened, Giglio says, was the militia guys panicked. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an operation under way, none of them knew what to do, all of them were very angry, and it was all very heat of the moment,\" he says. \"They took us to the people who were actually in charge and got a more level-headed person involved, and they released us.\u201d \n\nGiglio describes one of the men in charge as a local businessmen. The men who took him, he says, were likely locals\u2014no different than the guy who runs your local corner store. \n\n\u201cSome of the journalists, me and at least one other, had an invitation from the People\u2019s Mayor\u2019s press secretary. We were supposed to have people call her, which has worked in the past, but they just say, \u2018It\u2019s military now.\u2019 Everyone is freaking out, so obviously he\u2019s not in control. They said, \u201cThe People\u2019s Mayor? What does that even mean?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Giglio, who was detained in Egypt in August 2013 while reporting on the Muslim Brotherhood, is more ticked off than shaken. He didn\u2019t get to the heart of the story.\n\n\u201cEgypt was horrifying, but at least I was in the middle of the story when I was arrested there,\u201d Giglio says. \u201cThis just sucks.

Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the insurgent-appointed \"people's mayor\" of Sloviansk, was quoted by Russia's Interfax news agency as also saying two helicopters had been shot down. \n\nSee also: Crowds Grow Violent as Eastern Ukraine Marks May Day\n\nDespite that setback, Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, said Friday evening that the attack on rebel checkpoints around Sloviansk had left \"many insurgents dead, wounded and arrested,\" but did not give an exact number.\n\nHe admitted, however, that there were some hitches during the operation.\n\n\u201cThe operation doesn't unroll as fast as we want it to, and is significantly complicated by the fact that the terrorists' bases are located in the crowded cities and the terrorists themselves hide behind the civilians, take hostages and shoot from the windows of apartment buildings,\u201d Turchynov said. \"The offensive on the terrorists goes on.\"\n\nRussian news outlets reported that a third helicopter had been shot down by Kremlin-backed militia fighters. The third helicopter could not be confirmed.\r\n \r\nThe pro-Kremlin forces said at least one Ukrainian helicopter pilot was killed during the fighting, while another had been detained, according to the Associated Press.\n\n \r\nUkrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said in a post on Facebook that other military personnel had been wounded after the pro-Russian militants fired anti-aircraft missiles at Ukrainian military helicopters. Avakov said that nine illegal rebel checkpoints had also been destroyed, and that professional mercenaries were operating within the rebel group.\r\n \r\n\u201cAgainst Ukraine\u2019s special forces, terrorists used heavy artillery, including grenade launchers and portable anti-aircraft missile launchers,\u201d the minister said.\r\n \r\nReuters reported that its photographer had seen a Ukrainian military helicopter open fire on the edge of Sloviansk, while its reporter heard gunfire during the early-morning assault.\n\nRussia slammed Ukraine's action, with President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesman Dmitry Peskov calling the offensive \u201cpunitive\u201d and saying it effectively destroyed the \u201cfinal hope\u201d of a peace deal hashed out in Geneva between the U.S., Russia, Europe and Ukraine in March, Russia's Interfax news agency reported.\r\n \r\nAn AFP reporter on Twitter wrote that at least one military armored personnel carrier had been seized by the rebels, while a journalist for The New York Times said that the rebels were \u201con alert, readying to fight.\u201d\r\n \r\nThe action in Sloviansk marked a heightened military response by Kiev, which has been largely unsuccessful in recent attempts to purge the pro-Kremlin rebels from the region.\n\nAs recently as Tuesday, Turchynov, the acting president, acknowledged that a significant portion of the nation was beyond the government's grasp.\r\n \r\nSloviansk has been the main flashpoint in the deepening crisis in eastern Ukraine. Armed pro-Russian separatists demanding a referendum on secession and joining Russia have seized several key government buildings in Sloviansk and surrounding cities, and have taken several hostages, including journalists and military observers. Most remain held captive, reportedly in the basement of the city\u2019s security services building.\n\nMeanwhile, the southern port city of Odessa erupted in violence when a pro-Ukrainian group clashed with rival separatist supporters. One man was shot dead and several others were injured when the groups exchanged smoke grenades, paving stones and \u201cexplosive devices\u201d during the bloody clashes, Ukrainian police said in a statement.\n\nLive video from the scuffle in the mostly Russian-speaking seaside tourist town showed several people on both sides with bloody wounds to their heads and other parts of their bodies. Cars had their windows shattered and at least one building appeared to burn after a Molotov cocktail was tossed inside.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Below, Mashable answers some basic questions about the death penalty and how the process of lethal injection is carried out.\r\nWhich countries have the death penalty?\r\nThe United States is one of 58 nations that still practices capital punishment, along with Ethiopia, Afghanistan and North Korea. Japan and India are the only other major democratic nations that carry out this form of punishment.\n\nOf the 198 countries recognized by the Death Penalty Information Center, 98 forbid capital punishment. Seven of those countries allow it only in the case of \"exceptional crimes,\" such as one committed under military law. Thirty-five others allow it for \"ordinary\" crimes such as murder, but have not carried out an execution in at least 10 years and \"are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions,\" according to the center's website.\n\nIn the map below, click \"legend\" in the top left corner to see what the colors designate.\n\nHow many states in the U.S. have the death penalty?\r\nCapital punishment is still legal in 32 states. Maryland was the latest to outlaw the death penalty in 2013, though the ruling was not retroactive; the five inmates on death row there are still due to be executed.\n\nThe same is true for Connecticut and New Mexico, which outlawed the death penalty in 2012 and 2009, respectively. Connecticut's 11 death row prisoners and New Mexico's two are still up for execution by the state.\n\nClick \"legend\" at the top left corner of the map below to see what the colors represent.\n\nWhere in the U.S. do most executions take place?\r\nAs you can see in the map above, Texas has carried out the most executions in the U.S. since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, executing 515 people.\n\nVirginia and Oklahoma have executed 110 people each over the same time frame, with Florida executing 86 inmates and Missouri executing 74.\n\nTexas, it should be noted, has executed more people than all the other states combined.\r\nDo Americans support the use of capital punishment?\r\nMore than half of all Americans support the death penalty (55%), marking a significant decline from 1996, when 78% of the U.S. favored capital punishment, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nToday, 37% of Americans oppose it.\n\nThough the population as a whole is slightly in favor of capital punishment, the Death Penalty Information Center says some prominent minority groups are not. Just 40% of Hispanics support the death penalty, as opposed to 50% who oppose it. For African Americans, those numbers are an even greater contrast to the general population. Only 36% favor it, compared with 55% who oppose it.\r\nHow many states use other methods of execution, aside from lethal injection?\r\nLethal injection is the only means of execution for 20 of the 32 states that practice capital punishment. It is the primary option in all of those states but four. Some states allow alternative execution methods, should the state not have the means to administer the lethal drugs or if an inmate requests a different punishment.\r\nFlorida, South Carolina and Virginia allow inmates to choose between lethal injection and electrocution.\r\n\tMissouri allows death by lethal gas -- although the statute doesn't specify who gets to choose the method.\r\n\tInmates on death row in Alabama can request the electric chair.\r\n\tIn California and Wyoming, they can ask for lethal gas.\r\n\tIf there's nobody to administer a lethal injection in New Hampshire, prisoners can be hanged.\r\n\tDeath row inmates in Washington can ask for the gallows, too.\r\n\tOklahoma allows electrocution should lethal injection ever become unconstitutional. Utah has a similar clause, but favors a firing squad instead of the chair.\r\nHow does someone wind up on death row?\r\nIn states with the death penalty, a person who is convicted of first-degree murder or treason is likely to wind up on death row. But depending on the state, crimes including severe sexual battery, capital kidnapping, aircraft hijacking, \"drug crimes,\" arson and resisting arrest could also send a convict to the death chamber.\n\nThe vast majority of states, though, accept only a murder charge to consider capital punishment.\r\nHow does lethal injection actually cause death?\r\nLethal injection usually starts by rendering a person unconscious with a powerful anesthetic, followed by a cocktail of drugs that halt key bodily functions. In theory, the inmate shouldn't feel any pain.\n\nHowever, that didn't appear to be the case in Oklahoma.\n\nIn Tuesday's botched execution, the drug cocktail given to Lockett was a mix\u00a0of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride.\n\nThe process, in Lockett's execution, began with midazolam.\n\nMidazolam can be used to produce loss of consciousness before and during surgery, according to Mayo Clinic's website, a non-profit medical research organization and practice based in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida. \"This may allow the patient to withstand the stress of being in the intensive care unit.\"\n\nTen minutes after the midazolam injection, Lockett was declared unconscious, and a doctor began to pump the other two drugs into the prisoner's body.\n\nVecuronium bromide is a neuromuscular blocking agent, according to the website of the FDA. Like midazolam, it is also used in hospitals and can be administered in tandem with general anesthesia as an additional relaxant. Surgeons can use it to relax a patient's muscles during surgery, especially when they are required to stick a tube down a patient's throat, the FDA says. When used for lethal injection, the dosage is increased, making it enough to stop a patient's breathing.\n\nPotassium chloride is then used to stop the heart.\n\nThough potassium chloride can be taken in supplements by an otherwise healthy person with low levels of potassium, a high dosage of this chemical compound is deadly.\n\nThis method of execution is essentially death by overdose, and the latter two drugs can reportedly cause extreme pain if the person taking them is not unconscious.\n\nThis particular cocktail has been used in Florida along with Oklahoma, though the dose of\u00a0midazolam -- which was supposed to render Lockett unconscious -- is much higher in Florida prisons.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

He noted the social media giant\u2019s 10th birthday in February and his impeding 30th, on May 14.\n\nZuckerberg had taken stock of his life and loves (his wife, Facebook and philanthropy), and realized he wanted Facebook to be different. \u201cMy goal for the culture of Facebook is to build a culture of loving the people we serve that is as strong if not stronger than hacking at Facebook,\" he said.\n\nRemember those words, because on Wednesday, this speech and this F8 will likely be remembered as a turning point for Zuckerberg and Facebook. It\u2019s the day they grew up.\n\nSee also: Facebook for Android: 10 Tips for Power Users\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s reaction to turning 30 is not that surprising; most people grow reflective as they make the transition from youth to adulthood. However, it's remarkable how that more responsible, measured and rational approach permeated the entire F8 keynote and virtually every new plan and initiative Facebook unveiled during the roughly one-hour talk.\n\nZuckerberg told the audience that Facebook\u2019s mantra of \u201cMove Fast and Break Things\u201d would be replaced with the less pithy \u201cMove Fast with Stable Infra.\u201d It\u2019s not very catchy, but is a perfectly adult mantra for a company that\u2019s clearly maturing and anxious to build strong relationships with thousands of developers and partners relying on Facebook to help them build the next big thing in socially connected mobile apps.\n\nThe big goal: To build a stable platform. When you talk stability and put it up on the marquee, the message is clear: Your partners are the priority, not delivering shiny new objects.\n\nZuckerberg's promises were nothing short of stunning. Facebook app developers can now rely on a guarantee of two years of stability for Facebook APIs and login. So even as Facebook works to upgrade and iterate, third-party developer apps will still work just fine, the company promised.\n\nFacebook also unveiled API versioning to help with compatibility and, more importantly a 48-hour turnaround on all major bugs. It\u2019s a very customer- and partner-centric approach that is the hallmark of a grown-up company.\r\nLet\u2019s profit together\r\nZuckerberg also talked about putting \u201cpeople first,\u201d but it\u2019s really the current and potential Facebook developers that Facebook is putting front and center. It\u2019s a canny approach as Facebook tries to convince everyone else to hop on the mobile express.\n\nEven the structure of the keynote and F8 in general is focused less on high-level Facebook innovation and more on hand-holding for developers who may not believe or understand Facebook\u2019s intense mobile focus: Build, Grow and, of course, Monetize. On the last point, Facebook used honesty to help drive home its message.\n\nAside from Zuckerberg\u2019s speeches, which bookended the keynote presentations, Deb Liu -- who focuses on apps and monetization for Facebook -- offered the most compelling argument for app developers adopting Facebook\u2019s mobile approach. She told them frankly that two years ago, Facebook was the No. 1 app in the App Store, but wasn\u2019t making a dime in mobile. Now, mobile accounts for 60% of Facebook\u2019s revenue. One of developers\u2019 key questions is, \u201cHow do I make money on mobile?\u201d\n\nLiu outlined how Facebook did it and reminded developers that the social platform demands ads that are \u201cintegrated, not disruptive.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just lip service. Facebook also unveiled its Audience Network, designed to take the burden off defining audiences, tracking reports and managing billing. It\u2019s simply another instance of how Facebook is acting like the adult in the room by handling tasks the partners may not be able to do on their own. It\u2019s also Facebook\u2019s way of saying, \u201cWe\u2019re good partners, here to help you as much as you can help us. So come on in, the mobile app water is fine.\u201d\r\nYes, privacy matters\r\nZuckerberg once said that privacy is no longer a \"social norm.\" However, the nearly 30-year-old Facebook founder and CEO now clearly see things a bit differently. The decision to allow anonymous login through apps connected to Facebook is huge shift that could lead to similar allowances on Facebook\u2019s own mobile app and desktop experiences. It\u2019s also another sign of an adult who realizes he may want more control over his life and information.\n\nAdditionally, Facebook is now pushing granular login control to apps. Zuckerberg said he wants people to \u201cTrust the Blue Button\u201d they see on third-party apps; I think he finally understand that without some control, there is no trust. Facebook and Zuckerberg will, at least in this instance, no longer imperially direct what apps can and can\u2019t do on Facebook. I\u2019m not saying anything goes, but clearly more control is being pushed out to partners and users on third-party apps than ever before.\r\nYou can count on me\r\nAt last, you can count on Facebook to hold a developers conference every single year.\n\nSuch dependency is not just common courtesy, it\u2019s another clear sign of adulthood. Zuckerberg knows that Facebook cannot survive the next 10 years on his own. He still wants to grow and innovate, but instead of assuming Facebook partners will do his bidding and help grow the platform, Facebook is now actively trying to help them build, grow and make money.\n\nWhen you hit a milestone age like 30, people are quick to tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, 30 is the new 20.\u201d That, of course, is a lie. Ten years older is 10 more years of experience, with lows and highs, bad and good.\n\nAs Zuckerberg somewhat emotionally noted, it\u2019s been a decade since he met his wife and, though he didn\u2019t directly mention his efforts to deliver broadband to developing nations, that notion is never far from his mind (Internet.org is part of F8).\n\nZuckerberg at 30 is obviously less self-centered than Zuckerberg at 20 (or even Zuckerberg at 25). He\u2019s focusing less on \u201cMark\u201d and more on the world of people using or hoping to use and connect with his product. It\u2019s a transition we\u2019ve seen among other industry icons, from Steve Jobs to Bill Gates.\n\nNo one and no company is young forever. You can operate with the same drive and intensity as a startup, but the wisdom that comes with experience is worthless unless it's applied. Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are finally ready to put away the hoodie and contemplate adulthood.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

After two false starts in college, for all the 5'7\" point guard knew, he'd been ejected from the sport entirely. \n\nBy October, Kiwi was a desperate man. He traveled the West and paid money to participate in open tryouts for teams in the NBA Development League (D-League). \n\nHe needed to impress someone. Anyone. \n\nSee also: A YouTube Legend Battles for His Basketball Future\n\nOn Oct. 31, 2013, Kiwi sat nervously at a friend's house. He followed the D-League draft online and hoped just one team would give him a shot in the NBA's official minor league. Finally, in the draft's final round, the Santa Cruz Warriors gave him that opportunity. \n\nOn Dec. 12, 2013, Kiwi was the D-League's youngest player. He charged off the bench late in a game against the Bakersfield Jam to score 23 fourth-quarter points. He singlehandedly led a wild Warriors comeback just weeks after watching his basketball career nearly die on the vine.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever seen anything like this,\" Warriors coach Casey Hill told his assistants on the bench that night. \n\nNeither Hill nor Gardner knew this at the time, but many more special moments would follow. On Saturday Kiwi played in the D-League finals. The Santa Cruz Warriors' season ended there with a loss, but the team's surprise playoff run was a fitting end to a life-changing year for Kiwi, a season that seemed all but impossible this time last year. \n\nThis is the latest chapter in the story of Kiwi Gardner's ongoing basketball journey. It's a trip that comes straight out of a Hollywood screenplay, but is in fact the real life of a young man from the tough streets of Oakland, Calif. It's the story of a precocious ascent, a devastating fall and one hell of a comeback. And it's a tale with many chapters yet to come. \n\nFrom the bottom to the D-League\n\nAsked to describe his rookie year in a single word, Kiwi chose \"surreal\" on the day of Santa Cruz's final regular-season home game.\n\n\"I don't want to stop,\" he added, referencing some of the players and coaches he'd met over the past several months. \n\nKiwi's season averages (6.8 points and 2.9 assists per game in Santa Cruz) might seem pedestrian to the casual observer. But considering his journey to this point, they're downright phenomenal. \n\nKiwi, who turned 21 April 7, played basketball non-stop as a toddler inside his mother's home in hardscrabble East Oakland. His grandmother nailed a regulation metal rim to a bedroom wall. By adolescence, Kiwi's skills became the stuff of local renown. But it was in 2009, after meeting Travis Farris, that Kiwi found Internet fame. \n\nFarris, a Bay Area native in his 20s, supported his day job at Bed Bath & Beyond by relentlessly traveling Northern California to film local high school players. He set the best plays to hip hop beats and uploaded the resulting \"mixtapes\" to his YayAreasFinest YouTube channel. When Farris first saw a tiny, 16-year-old Kiwi dominate a team of future college stars in a local tournament, he knew he'd discovered a special subject. \n\nThanks to Farris, Kiwi's diminutive height, explosive athleticism, bouncy dreadlocks and on-court showmanship made him an instant hit with fans online, during his junior season. Millions upon millions of views piled up. Farris earned ad revenue, while the teenage Kiwi enjoyed notoriety among hoops junkies worldwide as one of basketball's first YouTube sensations. \n\n\"He's family to me now,\" Kiwi told me of Farris last fall. \"No doubt about.\" \n\nKiwi committed in 2010 to play for Providence College in the Big East, at the time considered America's top basketball conference. Then, just when it appeared he'd arrived, everything fell apart.  \n\nKiwi was deemed academically ineligible and had to sit out his first year at Providence. Just before his second year was set to begin, he was told the team no longer needed him. So he landed at a junior college in Texas, where he earned starting point guard. But he left that team mid-season after struggling to get along with a coach who months later made headlines for a series of strange, apocalyptic outbursts across the Southwest. \n\n Nearly two years out of high school and without a team, school or real plan, Kiwi had tumbled from YouTube fame to being off the basketball map entirely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018What am I playing for?\u2019\u201d he said. \n\nA former teacher connected Kiwi to a young agent named Noah Betzing, and the two formed a new plan: First, spend the spring and summer training up to eight hours per day. Then, embark on a barnstorming fall 2013 tour to try out for D-League teams throughout the West, while chronicling the journey in a YouTube series of his own, called The Truth.\n\n\u201cBasketball-wise, this is it,\u201d Kiwi told me in Oakland last autumn, two weeks before the D-League draft. \u201cIt\u2019s do or die now. I\u2019m putting all I got into this. All I got.\u201d\n\nOnly in rare cases do players actually reach the D-League via open tryout. But Kiwi impressed coaches in Santa Cruz; the Warriors selected him in the final round of the draft. Kiwi had earned an invite to training camp in November 2013. \n\nUnderage, undersized and playing against older players whose college games were regularly broadcast on ESPN, Kiwi held his own and earned a roster spot. The D-League pays little, and no player aims to spend his entire career there, but Kiwi had somehow completed his unlikely comeback from basketball purgatory. \n\nA new step, however, was just beginning.\n\n'People here see something in him.' \n\nIf making the Warriors roster was the culmination of a grueling, daunting process for Kiwi, earning Santa Cruz fans' love came effortlessly and immediately.\n\nAt the end of the Warriors' second regular-season game, chants of \"We want Kiwi! We want Kiwi!\" reverberated through Kaiser Permanente Arena. All this for someone who, just one month before, had considered life without basketball. \n\nA few days later, he scored a driving layup while being fouled on a fast break. It was a meaningless score late in a blowout win -- but the home crowd reacted as if he'd just made a game-winning buzzer-beater.\n\nTo call Kiwi a fan favorite in Santa Cruz would be \"the understatement of the year,\" said Adam Johnson, a writer whose Sea Dubs Central blog covers the Warriors.\n\n\"People here see something in him -- he's that guy that everyone can relate to,\" Johnson told me in April. \"In a world of giants, he's the regular guy. But he's more. You can see in his eyes he's not scared of anyone he goes up against. He's fearless and reckless at the same time.\" \n\nAs the season progressed, Kiwi's role grew from fan-favorite to key component of the team. One December night he exploded for 23 fourth-quarter points, many against Dennis Schroder, a touted prospect and first-round pick in the 2013 NBA Draft. Soon after, he outplayed one of the D-League's top players, Idaho Stampede point guard Pierre Jackson, in Santa Cruz. There were plenty of other sterling performances too, including this acrobatic game-winning assist in April:\n\nHe also developed a special relationship with Hill, Santa Cruz's first-year coach who took Kiwi under his wing as a personal project. \n\n\"I see the potential this kid has, and to have someone come as far as he as in the amount of time he's been with us is really kind of special,\" Hill told me near the end of the season. \"To see the very, very meaningful impact that basketball can have on his life, then to have some measure of control over that in my position, I feel somewhat responsible for him.\"\n\n\"It's not in me to look at him as just another player,\" Hill said. \n\nBefore long, fans began to recognize Kiwi around town. He signed autographs after games and even netted a small endorsement deal with startup shoe company TESH Sports. Two local weeklies ran cover stories on him mid-season. \n\nBut what if the Warriors hadn't nominated Kiwi as their final draft pick last October? Where would he be now? \n\n\"I'd probably be in school. I guess. Hopefully,\" Kiwi told me late in his rookie season.\n\nBoth he and and his agent remember how close his surreal Santa Cruz season was to never happening at all -- and how far Kiwi still has before reaching his ultimate goal, the NBA. \n\n\"There are a lot of Kiwi Gardners who never made it walking around East Oakland right now,\" Betzing said as the D-League season wound down. \n\nBut Kiwi's not the only one who grew up this season. So did the man who made him a YouTube hero.\n\n'Maybe his work was done.'\n\nAfter several years of manically driving around Northern California, countless hours editing basketball footage, hundreds of millions of YouTube views and undisputed status as the de facto kingmaker of Bay Area basketball, Travis Farris hung up his video camera and called it a career last winter.\n\n\"I'm 28 years old,\" Farris, who got married last year, told me this spring. \"If 10 more years go by and I'm still doing this, how weird would that be?\" \n\nKiwi was Farris' signature YouTube subject and they'd grown to be friends, so Farris followed the Santa Cruz season. Early on, he attended a Warriors home game. After the game, Farris snapped a picture of Kiwi (below) then uploaded it to Instagram with an emotional caption reflecting on their intertwined basketball lives: \n\nThey said he couldnt do it...There been a lot of ups and downs... but MY DUDE @easy_ki is a PRO BASKETBALL PLAYER!!! Proud of you tonight fam!!!\n\nWhen Kiwi was in high school, he and Farris would discuss his dreams -- college ball, pro ball, hopefully the NBA. \"He always had faith in me,\" Kiwi said late this season. Farris quitting YouTube mixes just as he reached a huge basketball milestone of his own, Kiwi said, was appropriate timing. \n\n\"Maybe it can just be a symbol,\" Kiwi told me. \"Like, maybe his work was done, you know?\" \n\nSights remain on the NBA\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only really one thing I wanna remember, you know?\u201d Kiwi told me last fall, as he teetered between the D-League draft and a future without organized hoops. \u201cThat\u2019s playing in the League [the NBA]. That\u2019s the only jersey, the only picture, the only film I want to remember.\u201d\n\nThat hasn't changed, and most will tell you Kiwi's growth during his rookie season -- on and off the court -- was phenomenal. Learning to play as an under-control point guard -- not an undersized, kamikaze scorer -- has been his biggest step, said Kiwi, Coach Hill and Johnson, the Warriors blogger. \n\nSo the question remains: Can 5'7\" YouTube sensation Kiwi Gardner make the NBA? \n\n\"It will be interesting to see where he is next year,\" Johnson said after watching and writing about the Warriors for Kiwi's entire first season. \"If he sticks with Santa Cruz and keeps getting better like he has, then with his trajectory I definitely think he can make it to the NBA next year or the year after.\" \n\nHill won't go that far. But he readily admits \"Kiwi's put himself in a wonderful position to be successful in the game of basketball for a long time.\" That could mean playing professionally in the NBA, China, Europe or elsewhere. \n\n More than anything, considering Kiwi's future reminds me of a story from his past, one his mother Kendra Gardner told me last fall. Kiwi was in middle school, and Kendra came in for a parent-teacher conference. The three of them -- Kendra, Kiwi and his teacher -- sat around a table. The teacher asked Kiwi what he wanted to be when he grew up. \n\n\"I'm playing pro basketball,\" Kiwi said. \"I want to make the NBA.\"\n\nThe teacher dismissed his idea as preposterous, encouraging Kiwi to pursue more realistic options. But after the meeting ended and they left the classroom, Kendra had a message for her middle-schooler son.\n\n\"Don't ever let anyone tell you what you're going to be or what you can do,\" Kendra remembered last fall. \"Don't ever stop living your dream just because someone says you're not going to do this or can't do that.\"\n\nAnd Kiwi hasn't stopped since. All that remains is how much farther he can go. \n\nKeep following Mashable for updates on Kiwi Gardner's tremendous basketball journey."},"shares":{"twitter":509,"facebook":367,"google_plus":6,"linked_in":10,"total":892},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzMwL2Q5L0tpd2lEcml2ZS41YjAwNy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/cd17ca50/4c6/KiwiDrive.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzMwL2Q5L0tpd2lEcml2ZS41YjAwNy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/5d8da51e/4c6/KiwiDrive.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzMwL2Q5L0tpd2lEcml2ZS41YjAwNy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/726dc9f5/4c6/KiwiDrive.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/PR6yzE","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2013/11/25/kiwi-gardner-basketball-youtube/"}]},"excerpt":"Nearly banished to basketball's hinterlands, YouTube idol Kiwi Gardner celebrates an explosive rookie season in the D-League.

Though accelerated development of the virtual-reality headset will be largely driven by video games, the idea of strapping immersive movies or TV shows to your head suddenly seemed inevitable.\n\nBut creating gaming content for VR looks easy compared with the challenge of capturing the real world for viewing through the mask. How do you block your actors? Should the camera move?\n\nSEE ALSO: The Virtual Reality Renaissance Is Here, But Are We Ready?\n\nAnd what kind of camera would you even shoot on in the first place?\n\nPalo Alto-based startup Jaunt has been quietly building just such a platform, which it hopes it can deliver to virtual reality headsets\u00a0not just immersive cinematic-style narrative content, but live events as well.\u00a0With a new $6.8 million capital raise, a full working demo and meetings scheduled all over Los Angeles, the company -- which has been toiling for months in \"stealth\" mode -- has de-cloaked and is ready to mingle.\n\nWhat they have now is a spiky disco ball-like cluster of several synched cameras that shoot all around, paired with software suite that stitches it all together, adjusting depth after the fact for a 3D effect. It takes about 10 times as long to render the footage as it does to shoot it, so the goal of a smooth, real-time broadcast to a VR headset is a ways off yet. But they\u2019re getting there.\n\nJaunt CEO Jens Christensen and his team are taking meetings with studios, agencies, directors and producers -- no one\u2019s allowed to name names just yet, but watch this space -- and they\u2019re open to ideas. Jaunt isn\u2019t in it to make the content; the focus is hardware and software.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the company from giving it a shot, at least for demo purposes. Jaunt gave Mashable an exclusive look Monday, and when I slipped on my mask and headphones, I most definitely wasn\u2019t in Starbucks anymore.\n\nInstead, I was standing at the bottom of an amoeba pool in a large skatepark, watching a BMX biker ride all around me. I could follow him, or just stare up at the walls, the sky, look behind me -- anywhere. The only intrusion to any part of my periphery was a small disc where my feet would otherwise be.\n\nAnother demo was the set of a sci-fi horror thriller (think The Thing remake with terrible acting and even worse special effects). The surround-sound in my headphones, captured by Jaunt\u2019s directional microphone (visible to the left of another prototype, below), cued me where to look: a wounded man trapped against metal stairs is straight ahead. A woman runs up on my right and starts shouting and points at a third man, who\u2019s losing a battle with a leggy insectoid monster on my left.\n\nIt\u2019s a convincing experience, one that will only get better when Oculus Rift releases its next-generation headset to developers this summer, with higher resolution and smoother motion. That\u2019s a good thing, too, because the current version is prone to blur and graininess.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to imagine how a James Cameron or Martin Scorsese would want the chance to noodle on it. We are, after all, witnessing not the extension of a medium, but the genesis of an altogether new one. And as with any new medium, it faces daunting technical and creative challenges.\n\nFor one thing, digitally rendered environments can be explored at will, whereas when shooting live action, the viewer will always be at the mercy of wherever the camera is positioned. And moving the camera around is not a good user experience -- yet -- so the position of each shot is fixed, at least for now.\n\nBut there\u2019s enough potential here that the company is backed by several entities including Redpoint Ventures and British Sky Broadcasting. And what little competition is out there is focused on creating content by cobbling together existing technology, such as Red cameras arranged in a circle, which doesn't allow for a full 360-degree experience.\n\n\"A lot of companies are being funded now in the VR spaces, lots getting funding soon,\" Brenden Iribe, cofounder and CEO of Oculus Rift, told Mashable. \"Before there was lots of venture funding being poured into mobile, all the different software, the same will happen in VR. So you'll definitely see things like 360 cameras. All these complimentary hardware devices that show up with VR, possibly much more than we saw with mobile, because you interact with the world in so many ways.\"\n\nRight now for Jaunt, the sky -- as well as the ground, and everything around you -- is the limit.\n\n\u201cBringing virtual reality to the wide entertainment market is a daunting proposition, but I believe the team that Jaunt has assembled is capable of doing exactly that, and doing it in a way that will make your jaw drop when you experience it,\u201d said Redpoint partner Tim Haley. \u201cThe virtual reality market is just beginning to pick up speed but you can already see how seriously people are taking it and the potential it really has.\u201d\n\nAt this point, you can\u2019t just buy a Jaunt camera and software suite to use on your own; to work with the Jaunt tech is to work with the company, whose production and postproduction protocols sound like they're a short step down from astrophysics.\n\nSpeaking of, how cool would it be to put a Jaunt camera on the next Mars rover?\u00a0Maybe the team should be taking a meeting up at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena next.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Seibert owns Frederator Studios, an independent animation studio he founded in 1997. \n\nBut since 2012, Seibert has had his sights focused firmly on YouTube.\n\nSee also: 9 Pickup Lines Inspired By Your Favorite '90s Cartoons\n\n\"I keep calling it the Woodstock of television,\" Seibert tells Mashable. \"It is the biggest audience of mass television viewing in the history of moving pictures.\"\n\nSeibert isn't joking. With over 1 billion unique users watching over 6 billion hours of video each month, YouTube's reach is stunning. According to Neilsen, the site reaches more U.S. adults aged 18 to 34 than any cable network. \n\nIt's easy to see why cartoon creators would forego the red tape and high pressure of cable television in favor of the Internet. Taking a cartoon from concept to production is grueling work, requiring a huge commitment from the creators and a huge paycheck from the network. More often than not, pitches never see the light of day.\n\nOn YouTube, that process is accelerated tenfold. Operating on a smaller scale with smaller risks, cartoonists can take a chance with more niche ideas and experiment with different styles. The free-for-all nature of the site allows them to have their hands in everything, from designing and writing to storyboarding and animation.\n\n\"It puts you in control, if it's your vision and it's your channel than whatever you do is yours,\" says Simon Tofield, creator of Simon's Cat. \"You don't have a team to impress or get in the way -- if you make something and it does well, it's good.\"\n\nTofield himself is the perfect example of that statement. An in-house animator working on advertisements in 2008, his short animated film about a cat blew up online, leading him to create what has become the second largest animation channel on YouTube, with over 2.9 million subscribers and 500 million views. In tow are four books, two apps and loads of merchandise. The success of Simon's Cat is surprising, given that the episodes are in black and white, without dialogue and don't follow a strict airing schedule.\n\n\"That's the beauty of YouTube,\" Tofield tells Mashable. \"On paper, if I had gone to someone with my idea of very simple line drawings, simple sounds, no color, it would've been turned down. But YouTube allows you to test these things.\"\n\nFor cartoon animators and writers, the freedom of YouTube is one of its main drawing points. Online distribution studios like Mondo Media and Frederator take a macro approach to series direction, whereas cable gets more micro with every passing year.\n\nWhen Seibert attempted to bring an adult-themed show called Super F*ckers to cable networks, he encountered meeting after meeting, each one encouraging more changes and asking more questions.\n\n\"I was going through useless pieces of conversation,\" says Seibert. \"Before they could say yes they wanted me to talk to their boss, who'd ask some other dumb questions so they could bring it to their boss, and on and on.\" \n\nAccording to Seibert, to go through the lengthy process with a high chance of being turned down at the end is agony. Super F*ckers now exists on Frederator's HangoverUncensored channel, with 12 episodes and almost 800,000 total views.\n\nWithout the risk of advertiser abandonment, censorship and \"red tape\" is all but nonexistent among YouTube cartoons. Creators -- even those with a studio backing -- have near complete freedom when it comes to seeing their stories told in whatever way they see fit.\n\n\"We've really never had a note on Dick Figures at all,\" says Ed Skudder, creator of Dick Figures, an immensely popular adult cartoon  web series following the adventures of two stick figures, Red and Blue. \"From day one they've just said 'You have two weeks. Manage your time and get us the episode.'\"\n\nThat creative freedom is unheard of on cable or network television, where standards and practices are set in place to protect audiences from certain types of mature content and keep advertisers happy. Scripts are read and changed, story arcs are shifted and the entire process takes much longer.\n\n\"On the surface, there are no standards and practices on YouTube,\" Seibert tells Mashable. Under the hood, however, YouTube's algorithms work much in the same way as television censors, making it harder to stumble across a show like  SuperF*ckers than the more family-friendly Bravest Warriors. The Internet's red tape is of the technological variety, keeping advertisers and consumers happy while allowing more adult shows to exist.\n\nThough YouTube lacks the prestige and support of cable or network television, creators like Bee and PuppyCat's Natasha Allegri are flocking to it to create their more niche-appeal ideas.\n\nHer show, following twenty-something Bee and the cute space-animal-thing called PuppyCat, is a blend of anime, subtle humor and badassery that, according to Allegri, can only exist online.\n\n\"A studio wouldn't have aired Bee and PuppyCat,\" Allegri tells me. \"It's a little, I guess, awkward.\"\n\nAllegri's brainchild, niche as it seems, has been viewed over 5 million times, after only two installments. A Kickstarter created to fund the series received almost $900,000. This success, Allegri says, is thanks in part to YouTube's reach and \"always on\" quality.\n\n\"What it comes down to, I think is that these studios are taking a chance and hoping their investment comes out okay,\" she says. \"I'm sure they've done their studies about risks, but I know what I like and what I buy so I create what I like.\"\n\nFor Allegri, creating an interesting, character-driven cartoon that reflects her vision -- rather than the vision of a larger network with a mainstream audience in mind -- is what brought her to YouTube in the first place.\n\nNiche cartoons can remain niche and not cause problems for executives, as there is no competition over time slots. For larger networks like Frederator, that peaceful coexistence all but eliminates the challenges of visibility.\n\n\"[YouTube] gives niche things a chance to live with more mainstream things,\" says Seibert. \"What's good about that is you can use your mass audience to introduce people to things they might not have seen and not really be upset if it doesn't translate.\"\n\nLike traditional cable and network cartoons, YouTube's biggest shows all have respectable followings on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr. These tools, along with the audience's ability to connect directly to the show through \"likes\" and comments, help to build fanbases quickly. \n\nAccording to Seibert, the future of cartoons on YouTube isn't certain just yet, but new mediums have historically caused rapid change in the animation world.\n\n\"When television came along, it wiped out theatrical cartoons. When cable came along, it basically wiped out broadcast cartoons,\" says Seibert. \"Now it might be that we're in a place where the Internet coming along -- if history is any judge -- is going to have a big effect on cable cartoons.\"\n\nThat's not to say YouTube is a television killer, as many have incorrectly predicted in the past. Today's most popular cable cartoons, like Adventure Time and Regular Show, offer some of the best stories (and highest ratings) in years. YouTube's current position in the cartoon industry seems to be more as a proving ground and foundation, for both shows and their creators.\n\n\"We have so many other things and other shows we want to get out there,\" says Skudder. \"So while we don't want to kill Dick Figures by any means, we are interested in pursuing other things as well -- we just have to find a balance.\"\n\nDigital cartoons are in a constant state of evolution. While conventional wisdom about online attention spans (and costs) have kept most series short and non-linear, industry leaders like Seibert and Tofield are willing to experiment.\n\n\"It doesn't matter the medium -- length is irrelevant if the audience is engaged,\" says Seibert, who is currently analyzing whether or not to adjust the length of popular series like Bravest Warriors.\n\nIn February, Frederator Studios announced it was joining forces with Simon's Cat, to handle its advertising and distribution. The merger's full results haven't yet been determined, but things certainly look good for YouTube-based cartoons.\n\nFor teams as small as those involved with Dick Figures or Simon's Cat, the consistent spread of their creations is extremely impressive.

Though it's zero degrees Fahrenheit outside, they're pouring sweat as they push their way toward the plunging cliffside a half mile away. With civilization a world away, the astronauts have only one mission this very moment: stay alive.\n\nWe're not on Mars. We're in the middle of the freezing desert of southeast Utah in December, where Mashable followed a six-person team living in a tiny habitat called the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS). Every two weeks during the winter, crews like this pay $500 each to rent the module and conduct experiments as though they were living on the Red Planet. \n\nSee also: Humans on Mars: Who Will Be First?\n\nThe MDRS is operated by The Mars Society, a group of volunteers around the world who support the idea of putting humans on Mars.

We could hear something, but saw nothing. We were placed on the floor of the car. It was like a police car, because it had a siren,\u201d Hapych told Ukrainian news station TSN in an emotional interview just after the two were released last Friday. \n\nHapych, who is from western Ukraine, said one of the kidnappers threatened to stab him to death, telling him: \u201cWith this knife I\u2019ve sent so many to the light.\u201d\n\nHe and his brother spent three days locked up in a cold, damp basement in the embattled eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk -- the latest flashpoint in Ukraine\u2019s deepening crisis -- with several other journalists that were abducted by pro-Kremlin paramilitaries. Some have been held for weeks in less-than-ideal conditions amid a conflict that has increasingly made them targets.\n\nSome of the captive correspondents are Westerners, such as American journalist Simon Ostrovsky, who was called a \u201cspy\u201d and \u201cprovocateur\u201d and nabbed near Sloviansk last week while filming a video report for Vice News. He was held in the same building as Hapych before being released on Thursday. His captors beat and blindfolded him, he said.\n\nBut the work and mere presence of one group of journalists in particular has provoked the ire of the pro-Kremlin crowd: Ukrainian journalists.\n\nSee also: Ukraine Journalists Race to Publish Secret Yanukovych Documents\n\nArmed with automatic weapons, the pro-Kremlin paramilitaries have laid siege to the region, storming key government buildings, constructing highway blockades to keep the Ukrainian military out. They have been working to control the country\u2019s gritty industrial region known as the Donbass, which, after the annexed Crimea region, is home to the second-largest population of ethnic Russians in Ukraine.\n\nThe gunmen have also targeted journalists, taking them as prisoners to be used as bargaining chips in negotiations with Kiev. At highway checkpoints, it has become the norm to find an automatic rifle pointed at journalists\u2019 heads while masked men dig through their bags and scrutinize accreditations.\n\nAmnesty International spoke out about the abductions in eastern Ukraine and called the situation there \u201cworrying,\u201d saying journalists and officials who were unlawfully detained must be released immediately.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing detention of journalists, municipal officials and residents by an armed group in Sloviansk speaks volumes about the lawlessness that has crept into parts of eastern Ukraine and raises fears the detainees could be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment,\u201d Heather McGill, the group's Ukraine researcher, said last Thursday. \n\nHuman Rights Watch weighed in with a statement on Tuesday, saying the escalating crisis is putting journalists at increasing risk of political-motivated violence, such as unlawful detention, abduction and assaults. \n\n\u201cAll politically motivated violence against journalists and activists is unacceptable and has to stop,\u201d said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cUkrainian authorities need to redouble efforts to protect people of all political stripes. International actors with leverage over the parties should press them to end abuses, release those unlawfully held, and ensure those responsible will be held to account.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of the Kremlin-backed rebels, journalists from Kiev and western Ukraine are \u201cliars\u201d and \u201cfascists\u201d who helped to overthrow the former president, Viktor Yanukovych, in February.\n\nOne of those journalists is Ukraine\u2019s Hidden Truth TV's 29-year-old chief editor, Irma Krat, who was captured in Sloviansk on April 20. On top of being called a liar, Krat\u2019s lawyer, Oleg Veremiyenko, told Mashable she was \u201ctaken hostage\u201d by pro-Russian militants on suspicion of torturing and killing a riot police officer while heading an all-women\u2019s self-defense group, a charge he called \u201cridiculous\u201d and false. She remains in captivity.\n\nHapych said his captors told him that they were holding him for \u201cdishonest\u201d reporting.\n\nOthers have faced intimidation for being \u201cpro-Kiev.\u201d The car of Oleksiy Matsuka, editor-in-chief of Donetsk-based online news website Novosti Donbassa, was set on fire. \n\nThe office of Konstantinovka newspaper Provinsia, whose editor Vladimir Berezin has received threats by pro-Russians in recent weeks there for his pro-Kiev stance, was also set ablaze. Both men were forced to leave their respective cities as a result.\n\nDue to the danger facing Ukrainian journalists in the eastern region of the country, many have pulled out and returned to Kiev and western Ukraine. The country\u2019s security service on Tuesday advised against them going back to the eastern region during the May holidays, due to the potential for an escalation in violence.\n\nAnastasiia Bereza, a journalist at Ukraine\u2019s largest internet news portal Ukrainska Pravda, returned to the capital last week after having a gun pulled on her by a member of the Kremlin-backed militia.\n\nPrior to that, she said, she was only able to operate in the area because she had tagged along with some Serbian colleagues and pretended to be reporting for Serbian media.\n\nOlga Rudenko, a Ukrainian journalist for Kiev-based Kyiv Post newspaper says representing yourself as being from somewhere other than Kiev is the only way to get access to the rebel-held region and evade outright hostility from the militants. But even that doesn\u2019t always work.\n\n\u201cI told them I was from Dnipropetrovsk, and that still wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she told Mashable. Dnipropetrovsk is an industrial city three hours southeast of Donetsk by car that is home to more than one million mostly Russian-speaking residents. Like Donetsk, its largest minority population is ethnic Russians.\n\n\u201cThey [the pro-Kremlin militants] said the city was full of \u2018Banderovtsi,\u2019\u201d she added, referring the derogatory term given by pro-Russians here to those from western Ukraine. It is derived from the former nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who colluded with the Nazis in World War II and is lionized by nationalist groups Right Sector and Svoboda.\n\nMoscow has used the groups to incite fear in the east, telling Russian speakers that the Ukrainian speaking \u201cfascists\u201d are plotting to restrict their use of the Russian language and are responsible for the killings of their comrades in Sloviansk, citing a business card of Right Sector leader Dmytro Yarosh left at the scene of the gun battle as proof.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian journalists have fared well amid the unrest in the east, being granted exclusive access to hostages, press conference and self-proclaimed local authorities. They are waved through checkpoints with little more than the show of a badge and a head nod.\n\n\u201cRussian journalists get all the help they need from [the pro-Kremlin militants],\u201d Bereza said. For them, \u201cthey open all the doors.\u201d"},"shares":{"twitter":1254,"facebook":143,"google_plus":12,"linked_in":30,"total":1439},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzI5LzY0L0lybWFLcmF0VWtyLmMwMzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/7fc23cdb/811/Irma-Krat-Ukraine.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzI5LzY0L0lybWFLcmF0VWtyLmMwMzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/a488f6fc/811/Irma-Krat-Ukraine.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA0LzI5LzY0L0lybWFLcmF0VWtyLmMwMzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/00dc4ac8/811/Irma-Krat-Ukraine.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1ivTk8a","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/02/28/ukraine-journalists-yanukovych-documents/"}]},"excerpt":"KIEV, Ukraine \u2014 With tears running down his cheeks, Ukrainian photojournalist Yevhen Hapych tells a nightmare of a story about the time he and his brother were kidnapped and subjected to psychological and physical torture. \u201cThey filled our ears with ...","channel":"US & World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/us-world/"},{"_id":"535e9c74b05f9d2d1a007a75","id":"2014/04/28/freeweibo-android-app-great-firewall-china","title":"Can an Android App Defeat China's Internet Censors?","title_tag":null,"author":"Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai","post_date":"2014-04-28T18:22:39+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Mon, 28 Apr 2014 18:22:39 +0000","sort_key":"1wET7G","link":"http://mashable.com/2014/04/28/freeweibo-android-app-great-firewall-china/","content":{"plain":"China has long had one of the most pervasive online censorship systems in the world. \n\nThe country's infamous \"Great Firewall\" blocks access to numerous Western websites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and The New York Times. But China also has laws that force Chinese companies and social networks to apply censorship within their own services. \n\nSee also: The 10 Countries With the Most Internet Freedom\n\nOn Sina Weibo, China's Twitter-like service that boasts almost 300 million users, hundreds of posts get censored every day. The social network has a sophisticated system that automatically censors certain keywords (\"June 4 massacre,\" referring to the Tiananmen Square protests, is blocked), and a team of in-house censors manually monitors other accounts and messages to catch whatever escapes the automated system. \n\nCensorship on Sina Weibo is not only effective, it's lightning quick. Researchers last year found that some posts, or \"Weibos,\" would be deleted as quickly as five minutes after being posted.\n\nA secretive group of online activists called GreatFire has been monitoring Chinese online censorship for three years. GreatFire's three collaborators track blocked websites and collect censored posts on Weibo, which they then publish on FreeWeibo.com. \n\nNow, the GreatFire activists are launching an app that they believe will make the Great Firewall of China and its mighty censorship powers obsolete, thanks to a relatively new approach called \"collateral freedom.\"\n\nThe Android app, also called FreeWeibo, allows users to read posts that are deleted from Sina Weibo, giving Chinese netizens a chance to see what their government censors, and what their fellow countrymen are really talking about. \n\nThe activists believe that the way they designed the app makes it impossible to be blocked -- which they hope will show others an effective way to circumvent Chinese Internet restrictions, furthering their goal of ending online censorship in China.\n\n\"Since the founding of our organization, I don't think we've come as close to achieving that goal as we are about to with the release of [the FreeWeibo] Android app. Because it's really changing the rules of the game,\" says a GreatFire founder who goes by the pseudonym Charlie Smith, in an interview via encrypted phone with Mashable.\n\nThe group is confident FreeWeibo cannot be blocked because of the way they have built it: All of the app's content is hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 could-hosting platform. \n\nWhat makes Amazon's cloud perfect for this project is that it's all encrypted, making the task of censoring content on it almost impossible. When a Chinese netizen visits content hosted on AWS, Chinese censors can see only that the user is visiting s3.amazonaws.com, but not the exact final address. China can't selectively block just some content on AWS without blocking the entire service. \n\nAnd therein lies the key to the project: Thousands of businesses rely on Amazon's cloud in China. The government probably can't afford to block the service entirely just to kill FreeWeibo. It's a strategy researchers call \"collateral freedom.\" It makes it impossible for governments to block access to a service because the collateral economic costs of doing so would be too crippling. \n\n\"That's incredibly powerful because then it's an all-or-nothing strategy,\" says Michael Carbone, the Manager of Tech Policy and Programs at the human rights organization Access, who specializes in Chinese digital rights. \"Either the censors allow access to that website and that service entirely, or they have to block the whole thing. They can't do selective blocking of certain pages that have censored content.\"\n\nThe term was first mentioned in a paper published last year, which explained how hosting sensitive content on platforms that are widely used within China makes it much harder to be blocked. The first real-world test of this theory came in January 2013, when China blocked the popular coding site GitHub and had to unblock it just two days later after Chinese developers protested against the move.\n\nThe new FreeWeibo app is a perfect example of this strategy.\n\n\"What they're doing with collateral freedom with this Amazon Web Services thing is really potentially transformative because it shows people a way of really sharing information without having fear of having information restricted,\" Jason Q. Ng, the author of the book and website Blocked on Weibo, and a researcher at the University of Toronto, tells Mashable.\n\nGreatFire's first tries at collateral freedom\n\nGreatFire was founded in 2011 by Smith, Martin Johnson and Percy Alpha -- all pseudonyms. None of the three has ever revealed his real name; Smith says they don't use their real names even among themselves out of fear of China's reprisal. \n\nTheir fears might be justified, given the most recent crackdowns on Chinese bloggers and dissidents.\n\nSmith says the three activists have never met in person. Smith seems to have an American accent, but he says they have close ties to China. Smith declined to answer any questions about who they are, where they came from or where they are based.\n\nThis is not the first time GreatFire has tried the collateral freedom approach. In 2012, the group launched its FreeWeibo website, but China blocked it just five days later. Last year, GreatFire created a mirror site on AWS. Now the FreeWeibo site gets 600,000 visits a month. Based on the language settings of the visitors, Smith says 95% of them are from China.\n\nIn 2013, China censored Reuters' website, so GreatFire created a mirror site on Amazon, accessible on an s3.amazonaws.com address. That allowed readers inside China to visit the site even without using online circumvention tools like VPNs or Tor, which allow people to circumvent the firewall but can be hard to use for non-tech savvy users. \n\nThe downside of hosting a site on AWS is that a URL like https://s3.amazonaws.com/freeweibo./index.html is not as easy to remember as freeweibo.com.\n\nFor that reason, the GreatFire activists thought releasing a FreeWeibo app would be the next natural step. So last year the group launched a FreeWeibo app for iOS.\n\nThe app became relatively successful, but after just one week, China blocked the app's download link. GreatFire initially created a workaround by pushing for periodical updates (Apple creates a different download link for every new update). At that point, the activists were confident nothing could stop FreeWeibo on iOS.\n\n\"When you are able to get around the Chinese censorship authorities, that's pretty cool. We thought: OK, we're there,\" Smith says.\n\nBut then, something unexpected happened. The app was completely removed from the App Store. FreeWeibo on iOS was effectively dead.\n\n\"The nightmare that you hope would never happen, actually happened,\" Smith says. \"And that was it.\"\n\nSmith says the Apple app review team sent an email saying the app had been removed because it included \"content that is illegal in China.\" He showed a copy of the message to Mashable.\n\nAfter that disappointment, in November 2013, Smith, Johnson and Alpha started working on the Android app. Now, almost six months later, the app is ready. The group released it two weeks ago, without publicity. It has been downloaded 2,000 times so far, according to Smith.\n\nCan this really work?\n\nGreatFire, of course, is not the only group fighting censorship in China. Since the early 2000s, when Chinese-born software engineer Bill Xia created Freegate, one of the first VPNs targeted specifically at China, many similar circumvention programs have been released, including Psiphon and Ultrasurf. \n\nVPNs have long been one of the most effective ways to get around the Great Firewall and access blocked sites, but at the end of last year, some VPN providers started reporting major disruptions in China.\n\nThe new crackdown on VPNs is just the latest in a long cat-and-mouse game between Chinese authorities and Internet freedom activists, says Carbone, the specialist at Access. \n\nFreeWeibo doesn't provide the same circumvention capabilities of VPNs, and it's targeted to just one service, Sina Weibo. But given that the censorship of Western sites has pushed many Chinese to stay within the firewall and mostly use local Internet services, the FreeWeibo app could make a real difference, Carbone says.\n\nGiving citizens the opportunity to read blocked Weibos may not be revolutionary, but the app does have the potential to reach many people. \n\nAccording to the latest estimates, almost 300 million people in China have an Android phone, and Sina Weibo is extremely popular, with 280 million registered users. \n\nDespite its popularity, Sina Weibo is crippled by censorship. The company itself, in its recent IPO filing, admitted that China's censorship requirements are an obstacle to the company's growth. \n\n\"Failure to [censor] may subject us to liabilities and penalties and may even result in the temporary blockage or complete shutdown of our online operations,\" the company wrote in its regulatory filing with the SEC. \n\nFreeWeibo gets around the censorship thanks to software that automatically scrapes Sina Weibo, downloading and storing posts continuously. The software then checks to see which posts have disappeared, and saves those. Smith says they don't catch all the posts, but they get the vast majority. FreeWeibo now hosts more than 370,000 censored posts, according to Johnson. \n\nThe big hope for GreatFire is that FreeWeibo on Android won't be as easy to block as its iOS counterpart. Android apps in China are distributed through multiple, decentralized markets -- none controlled by Google -- so it's going to be harder for China to get FreeWeibo removed. GreatFire is also relying on various distribution channels: the group's website, its AWS mirror and the Google Play Store for those outside of China.\n\nThe single point of failure is potentially Amazon. Even if China can't block FreeWeibo's app itself, it could perhaps persuade Amazon to remove it or shut down GreatFire's AWS account.\n\nWhen GreatFire used Amazon to host the mirror of the Reuters website, Amazon kept quiet, declining media requests for comment and basically playing the role of an innocent bystander. But it's unclear what it will do if FreeWeibo becomes a huge hit, especially now that Amazon is moving into China, where it launched a localized version of Amazon Web Services in December of last year. \n\nAmazon could theoretically agree to censor some content on AWS as part of the deal to open AWS China -- although it's hard to see how any type of deal like that would affect accounts hosted on the American version of AWS, like GreatFire's accounts.\n\nDavid Robinson, one of the authors of the collateral freedom report, says that at this point it's not known \"exactly what censorship laws, if any, Amazon may have agreed to abide by in its China-based service.\"\n\nAmazon did not respond to Mashable's request for comment.\n\nThe nightmare scenario, Carbone says, is that China might force all local businesses to move to Amazon's Chinese version of AWS (hosted at amazonaws.cn), where the government can presumably exert more control. At that point China could even afford to block the regular AWS domain (amazonaws.com) entirely. \n\nExperts like Ng and Robinson think that's a possibility, however remote.\n\n\"Practically speaking it would be incredibly difficult to push everyone to a localized service,\" says Harlan Yu, another co-author of the collateral freedom paper.\n\nSmith, the GreatFire collaborator, says they're ready for something like this: They would then rely on other cloud services providers, but none of those would probably be as big as Amazon.\n\nIt's also hard to know whether the FreeWeibo app's model can be replicated. Smith says they hope organizations like The New York Times, which is currently blocked in China, could put out an app with content hosted on AWS and get around censorship. \n\nBut it won't be that easy. It's one thing to host a simple app on AWS; it's another to host the mirror of an entire news site that gets constantly updated.\n\n\"That's actually a pretty big engineering challenge,\" Yu says. \"It's not as simple as hosting an Android app.\"\n\nWhatever happens, Smith, Alpha and Johnson say they will continue the fight.\n\n\"Our goal is to end online censorship in China. That's the endgame for us,\" Smith says. \"And we won't rest until we have achieved that goal.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?
