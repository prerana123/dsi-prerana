## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) is a classification modeling method, and one of the most popular and widely used learning algorithms. Use the breast cancer dataset to illustrate your understanding of kNN Clustering and predict classes.

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Read in Fair Data, which is a "take" of Ashely Madison Data Dumps with no personalized information
- Identify features and target
- Use kNN classification from Scikit-Learn

####Datasets

- [Ashley Madison Data Hack and Leak Discussed](https://www.agari.com/exploring-the-ashley-madison-dataset/)
- [Walk through of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data)

#### Deliverable

- The purpose of this lab is to practice performing Classifications using kNN.
- Demonstrate reading a data file, separating features and target, and fitting a logit model.
- Perform classifications (predictions) on new data

## Starter Code
- Please review the ipython notebooks available in the starter_code section
