## Introduction


This lab is to demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of kNN classifications on a dataset and practice using the Python syntax when using kNN functions library.

## Exercise

Using the [public dataset here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/wine.csv), perform a kNN Classifier on the wine features of ‘density’, ‘sulphates’, ‘residual sugar’ and the target is as ‘high quality’.

- Determine the k value by looping through a range of values.
- Plot the results of your analysis.

#### Requirements

- Develop a Python program to perform kNN Classification on the dataset
- Tune the kNN model by finding the optimal K value
- Run Logistic Regression on the dataset
- Tune Logistic model with regularization

#### Starter code
- Python [Starter Code](./code/starter-code/Week 4. - 2.4 Lab Start Code.ipynb)


#### Deliverable

- Outline Python program to perform kNN Classification
- Build a logistic regression model
- Create a writeup on the interpretation of findings
