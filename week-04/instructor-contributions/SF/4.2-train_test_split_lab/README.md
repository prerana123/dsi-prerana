## Introduction

For this lab we'll be working on our Project 4 dataset. Your goal is to split the data, then run Logistic Regression using sklearn. After this, you'll evaluate and tune your model.


#### Starter code

For this lab, you will be using your own notebook for the Project 4 dataset.

However, we have provided an example of the type of approach you should take, using the standard IRIS dataset. Please use this as a reference when working on your Project 4 dataset.

- IRIS [Demo Code Reference for Lab 4.2](./code/)

#### Deliverable

Perform Logistic Regression on your Project 4 dataset! See Project 4 for more details.
