## Introduction

Use Tableau on Project 4 dataset comparison plots. Make plots of K vs accuracy.

- Compile your comparison data in a tabular manner in CSV file format.
- Open Tableau and create a new data source pointing to your data.
- Create a new Tableau Worksheet and produce a scatter plot of the measure pairs.

## Hint:
A scatter plot requires two measures and one dimension.  Drop one measure on the ‘Rows’ bar and one measure on the ‘Columns’ bar.  To plot individual points on the scatter plot, make sure that you also drop the dimension representing unique tests on the ‘Color’ mark button.



#### Requirements
- Use your data to produce a scatter plot of the measure pairs.


#### Starter code

Here's a few sentences explaining any started code that's included in the `starter-code` folder.

#### Deliverable
- Use tableau to make plots of kNN: k vs accuracy, k vs precision, k vs recall
- Use tableau to make plots of logistic: C vs accuracy, C vs precision, C vs recall
- Use tableau to put best kNN and best logistic on the same plot
