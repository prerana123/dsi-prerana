## Introduction

In this lab we're going to practice writing functions using if/else and loops.

#### Requirements

- Write a function that takes a single movie and returns True if its IMDB score is above 5.5
- Write a function that returns a sublist of movies with an IMDB score above 5.5. (HINT: you may want to but do not have to    reuse the function from question 0.)
- Write a function that takes a category name and returns just those movies under that category.
- Write a function that takes a list of movies and computes the average IMDB score.

**Bonus:**
- Write a function that takes a category and computes the average IMDB score (HINT: reuse the function from question 2.)
