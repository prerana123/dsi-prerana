## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to practice writing simple functions.

#### Requirements

- Write a function with one argument. Find the area of a square.
- Write a function with two arguments. Find the area of a rectangle.
- Write a function with three arguments. Find the surface area of cuboid.

**Bonus:**
- Write a function that takes a category and computes the average IMDB score (HINT: reuse the function from question 2.)
