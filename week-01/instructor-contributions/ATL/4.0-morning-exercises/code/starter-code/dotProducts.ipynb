    "# Dot products and directions\n",
    "We talked about dot products yesterday.  A dot product between two vectors **p1** and **p2** in 3D space is (x1\\*x2 + y1\\*y2 + z1\\*z2).  We talked about how when a normalized dot product is close to +1, it means that the vectors are very similar, and when a normalized dot product is close to -1, it means that the vectors are very different.  Let's see how we can take advantage of this meaning of dot products to score how similar or different two words are."

Now, we discussed how more similar vectors give greater dot products, and what vector could be more similar to itself *than itself?!*  So why do we get the same value, 1.0, for the dot product between E and itself and the dot product between E and NE?  It's because we haven't *normalized* the vectors.\n",

When you have a right triangle, Pythagorean's theorem tells us that *a^2 = b^2 + c^2*, where *a* is the hypotenuse, and *b* and *c* are the \"legs\" of the right triangle.  So *a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)*.  Now inside the square root, you have the formula for the dot product! (*b^2 + c^2 = b\\*b + c\\*c*, and these two legs are simply the two coordinates in the two dimensional space.)\n",
