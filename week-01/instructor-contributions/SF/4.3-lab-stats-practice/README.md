## Introduction

Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the 
average (mean), or expected value. A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are 
very close to the average. A high standard deviation means that the numbers are spread out.

Statisticians use variance to see how individual numbers relate to each other within a data set, 
rather than using broader mathematical techniques such as arranging numbers into quartiles. A 
drawback to variance is that it gives added weight to numbers far from the mean (outliers), since 
squaring these numbers can skew interpretations of the data.

#### Requirements

- Write a function that computes the standard deviation
- Write a function that computes the variance
- Compare your functions to the results of the numpy equivalents
