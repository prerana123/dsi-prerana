## Introduction: Why Use arrays? (5 mins)

An array is a collection of related data items, called elements, associated 
with a single variable name.Arrays can ease programming and offer improved performance. 
When writing an application, you are usually faced with the problem of storing and 
manipulating large collections of data. Arrays simplify the task of naming and 
referencing the individual items in each collection.  Using arrays can boost the 
performance of your application . Arrays let you manipulate an entire collection of data 
items with a single SQL statement.

<a name="Matrices and arrays"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice / Codealong: Matrices and arrays (20 mins)

An array is a data structure that allows you to group several numeric or string 
variables under a single name. It may be one-dimensional list, a vector, or a
two-dimensional table or matrix, or it may have several dimensions. An array may 
contain either string or numeric values, but a given array may not contain both 
types of values.

As mentioned above, a matrix is a specific type of array, that is 2D. 

[arrays and matrices](http://www.truebasic.com/node/1038)

Here's a great picture showing the difference between vectors, matrices, and arrays.

Let's use numpy to create an array. 

in iPython notebook type:
```bash
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = np.array([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
```
You've just created your first two arrays! Since we know that matrices are simply 
a 2D array, we'll just keep keep our focus on arrays for the moment. Since there may be some
confusion using matrices and arrays, some Python users find it easier just to stick with arrays. 
You can read more about the confustion between the two and some problems that arise
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12024820/danger-of-mixing-numpy-matrix-and-array)

**Check** What is the difference between a vector, a matrix, and an array? Is a vector an array? 
Is an array a vector? Is a matrix an array? Is an array a matrix? 



<a name=" Adding and subtracting two arrays"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice / Codealong:  Adding and subtracting two arrays (20 mins)

Let's take a look at the two arrays we just created above. 
```bash
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Let's add them together. 
[6, 6, 6, 6, 6]


Now, let's let numpy do the work. 
in iPython notebook type:
```bash
np.add(a, b)
```
Thanks numpy, that was easy!


Let's try subtraction. 
[-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]


Now, let's let numpy do the work. 
in iPython notebook type:
```bash
np.subtract(a, b)
```
Thanks numpy, that was easy!



<a name=" The dot product"></a>
## Demo / Guided Practice / Codealong:  The dot product (20 mins)

The dot product is one way to multiply arrays. 
The dot product is represented like [this]:

![](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/blob/Week-1-Lesson-4.1/curriculum/04-lessons/week-01/4.1-lesson/assets/images/dot%20product.png)

Let's take a look again at the two arrays we just created above. 
```bash
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
b = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Using the formula for the dot product that we just learned, let's find the dot product for our 
two arrays. 

1 * 5 = 5
2 * 4 = 8
3 * 3 = 9
4 * 2 = 8
5 * 1 = 5
       --
       35
       
Now, let's let numpy do the work. 
in iPython notebook type:
```bash
np.dot(a, b)
```
Thanks numpy, that was easy!

<a name="ind-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice: Topic (20 minutes)
- Create 2 arrays. Add them together, subtract them, and do the dot product. 



<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion (5 mins)
- What's the difference between a matrix and an array? 
- Explain how to add to arrays together, subtract them, get the dot product to a partner.
