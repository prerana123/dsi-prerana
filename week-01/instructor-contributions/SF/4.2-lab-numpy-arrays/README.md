## Introduction

We were just introduced to numpy, now let's use it! 

One of the main reasons you may want to reshape an array is 
to change its dimensions. Remember, a vector is a 1D array, a matris is a 2D array, but arrays can have several
dimensions. One example may be that you want to reshape a 3D array into a vector or a matrix, to make 
manipulating the data easier. 

A reason you may want to transpose a data set is to transform it from a "tall and skinny" data set to a 
"short and fat" data set or vice versa. It depends on what type of analysis you're doing, but using
transpose will help you put your data set in a format that is most condusive to what you want to 
accomplish.

#### Requirements

- Create an array
- Reshape the array
- Transpose the array

**Bonus:**
- Different ways to index the array
