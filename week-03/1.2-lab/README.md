## Objectives

- Practice pandas reading in data and selecting columns
- Practice plotting techniques

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

You are a data scientist at a property investment firm and are tasked with
identifying good housing properties for future investment. The first step in
this process is understanding what characteristics are associated with
housing values. In other words, you need to build a model that predicts, from
available data, the value of a housing property.

> Instructors: A follow up step would be to find properties that are undervalued
now and may have favorable characteristics in the future, according to the created
model. Be prepared to discuss how to use the model for this scenario, for example
by searching for neighborhoods that local parks are being built nearby. Additionally,
you could discuss ways in which the property values might decrease, such a large
highway being built nearby.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

The starter code contains a few exercises:

- After walking through an example plots, students are asked to make several more.
- Students should then discuss any plots that reveal interesting relationships between the variables. This and the previous exercise can be done in small groups.
- Advanced students can explore using Seaborn to make plots more efficiently

**Bonus:**
- Put in the effort to make the plots look better. For example, including units by reading the data set description page.
- Plot the two best variables on the same plot with different colors for the points.


#### Starter code

Using the [starter code](./code/starter-code/W3-Lab-1.2-Starter.ipynb)
* Download the dataset
* Load the data into pandas
* Follow the instructions to generate plots of variables that may be usefully related
