## Introduction

> At this point students have already done most of the heavy lifting for this
lab and we've been talking about communication skills for the past few lessons.
So there's no extra starter or solution code for this lab. Take a look at the
[solution code](../3.4-lab/code/solution-code/3.4-Data-Workflow-Lab-2-Solutions.ipynb) for Lab 3.4 for an example of a visual for this dataset.

> If students need more time to flesh out their models and analysis then devote
lab time to that. Otherwise it's up to you how you want students to work
on the material. A few options:
- Split students up into two groups by project scenario and let them share ideas,
but emphasize that everyone needs to do their own write-up and analysis for
the project.
- If you had time in Lesson 5.1 to discuss stakeholder analysis for Project 3,
you may want to devote more lab time to individual work for students to
make progress on the project.
- For the stakeholder communication practice you might have students pair off
and have one be the stakeholder and the other the data scientist. Then have them
shuffle their pairs and change roles. This should help students think through
stakeholder motivations and interests.

> The second scenario (business expansion) involves more technical work
(local-level modeling), while the tax scenario has more stakeholders. This
should be reflected in student writeups.


In Labs 3.3 and 3.4 we dug into the data set for Project 3. Now that we've
learned about stakeholder analysis its time to take a closer look at
how we will present our findings.

As a first step you should identify all the stakeholders involved. At a
minimum you should clearly define the primary stakeholders. For the tax
board scenario, the stakeholders include the Iowa state government, relevant
business owners, and consumers. Which are primary and which are secondary?

For the second scenario (business owner expansion), one primary stakeholder
is the business owner. Are there any others? Any secondary stakeholders?

When presenting your results to your primary stakeholder, keep in mind that they
may then present your results to secondary stakeholders. For example, if the
Iowa state government decides to increase or decrease the state's alcohol sales
tax, that will have to be explained to e.g consumers. An excellent write-up
would address this need of the primary stakeholder.

## Some ideas to get you started

* **Scenario 1**: The tax board may want to increase government revenue, but they
also don't want to upset the community
of business owners or consumers. So part of the presentation of results to
the primary stakeholder could include advise on how the primary stakeholder
will present results to the secondary stakeholders.
* On the other hand, the tax board might want to reduce taxes if possible as a
form of economic relief to secondary stakeholders, and growth in revenue may
allow that to happen.

* **Scenario 2**: in the business owner scenario, the secondary stakeholders could include
employees, other business owners in the area, the licensing board for alcohol
sales, and many others. Helping the owner address the secondary stakeholders
adds a TON of value to your results.


## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Identify *different* stakeholders for your Project 3 scenario.
- Preform any additional regressions (if needed)
- Create your visuals using matplotlib / seaborn or Tableau. Now is the time to
make sure you have well-labeled axes, appropriate titles, and all around
high-quality visuals.
- Prepare your presentation for different stakeholders.
- Practice communicating results to each stakeholder (they don't care how smart
your analysis is, just the business value as relevant to THEM)


**Bonus:**
- Repeat the stakeholder analysis for the other scenario (the one you did not
choose), it's always good to take multiple perspectives on a set of data.
- Create additional scenarios for the same data set. Can you imagine other
stakeholders, such as public health officials, and relevant scenarios?

#### Starter code

Use your code from Labs 3.3. and 3.4 as your starter code.

#### Deliverable

The deliverable for this lab should be a strong outline for your Project 3
writeup with the stakeholder analysis sections filled out as much as possible.
