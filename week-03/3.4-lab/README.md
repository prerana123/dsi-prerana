## Introduction

> Recap the previous lab and review any common obstacles or questions.

Proceed with your analysis of the Project 3 data set! You may need to compute new columns as you proceed. Fit one or more linear models to the data, investigate model fits and outliers, use regularization when appropriate.

If you need additional time to finish the previous lab, make sure to pick up where you left off.

## Exercise

#### Requirements
- Perform exploratory analysis
- Generate correlation matrix of the features
- Generate linear regression models
- Evaluate model fit

If appropriate for your models and features:
- Use [feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html) to pick the best features
- Try different regularization options

**Bonus:**
- Continue working on the project. Prepare your write-up to stakeholders, fit additional models, and complete any other tasks. Recall the two scenarios for Project 3 and work toward models that address the central goals of predicting 2016 full year sales from 2015 and Q1 2016 data.

#### Starter code

The [starter code](/code/starter-code/3.4-Data-Workflow-Lab-2-starter.ipynb) has an outline to get you going.

> There are many valid solutions. [Solution Code](./code/solution-code/3.4-Data-Workflow-Lab-2-Solutions.ipynb)

#### Deliverable

By the end you should have fit a model of some kind that addresses a Project 3 scenario.
