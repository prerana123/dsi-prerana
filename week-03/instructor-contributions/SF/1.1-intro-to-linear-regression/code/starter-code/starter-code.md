Starter code, when necessary, should live in this folder. 

You can format starter code in markdown, python script, iPython notebooks, or whatever else is needed.

If including multiple sections - e.g. starter code for a guided practice and for an independent practice, clearly divide them by heading.

If including multiple files, include a readme to list contents. 


The relative link to a starter-code file from the lesson/lab would be:
`[name](./code/starter-code/file.py)`
