### Overview

To augment our 3rd project on liquor store sales, we want to introduce a few more specifics to practice.

Ultimately, we want to develop a process oriented mindset to assessing new problems.  Important considerations include:

* Assessing the data you have
* Identifying its shortcomings
* Making a clear problem statement / hypothesis
* Framing the problem as a potentially valuable business problem or case-study
* Outlining a high-level plan of action
* Communicating the findings

### Good Problem statements

Making a solid hypothesis is crucial to keep a study on track. A good hypothesis is:

* **Falsifiable:** can the hypothesis be proven false?
* **Testable** -- Feasibly addressable by the data available or obtainable
* **Measurable:** the hypothesis can quantified statistically
* **Reasonable:** An educated guess based on the data
* **Specific:** Targeted and completable in a specified time frame.

#### An Example

Management of a small startup isn't shipping releases on time, and the releases that are shipped aren't hitting good metrics.  The CTO, who is not a manager, is totally stretched and it's obvious there isn't enough time deal with the "why" of the problem.

What are some ways we can reframe this problem to make it more actionable within the premise of a finite set of outcomes?

### Assessing Your Data

The first step in any study design is planning for the data you need to investigate your target subject.

#### What data do you have?
* What shortcomings does it have?
* Is it relevant to the chosen problem?
* Is it missing a lot of values?
* Is there a lot of error in measurement?
* Is there significant sampling bias?
* Can you obtain other data that will augment the existing data, or act as a control or validation data set?

### Outlining a Plan of Action

Before you begin any project, you should put together a plan of action, coordinating any efforts between your team members.

* Collect/ Obtain the data
* Clean the dataset and prepare to analysis
* Analyze the data, compute summary statistics, build models, validate predictions
* Collect and analyze additional data if needed
* Communicate the results

_Note: It's also important to do a proper cost benefit-analysis and to consider any ethical implications of a study. If the data is expensive to obtain and the benefits minimal, your time may be better spent elsewhere. It's also very important to consider anyone that may be affected (adversely or positively) by the study. We'll talk about this much more when we get to stakeholder analysis in future lessons / discussions._

### Project 3 Overview - Group Activity

[Full Project 3 Details](../../projects/project-03/readme.md)

This week we learned how to use scikit-learn to run linear regression models, how Goals & Business Objectives translate to Model Fit, and also how to define and apply the principles of regularization & optimization. We worked a lot with housing data and predicting prices. Now we're going to use these skills to dig into a rich set of data!

The state of Iowa provides many data sets on their website, including [this dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pf5n5sgfgiri3i8/AACkaMeL_i_WgZ00rpxOOcysa?dl=0) which contains transactions for all stores that have a class E liquor license. You can choose one of the following two scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: State tax board, GROUP A

You are a data scientist in residence at the Iowa State tax board. The Iowa State legislature is considering changes in the liquor tax rates and wants a report of current liquor sales by county and any other possible projections for the rest of the year.  Ultimately, these findings will influence the potential rate hike on alcohol.

**Goal for Scenario #1:** Your task is as follows:

* Describe the dataset
* Form a hypothesis / write a problem statement
* Layout the value proposition -- how is this valuable / what can we do potentially?
* Sketch a plan of action which includes how you will approach this problem as a group
* Communicate your plan to the class (10mins)


#### Scenario 2: Market research for new store locations GROUP B

A liquor store owner in Iowa is looking to expand to new locations and has hired you to investigate the market data for potential new locations.

**Goal for Scenario #2:** Your task is to:

* Describe the dataset
* Form a hypothesis / write a problem statement
* Layout the value proposition -- how is this valuable / how is this valuable / what can we do potentially?
* Sketch a plan of action which includes how you will approach this problem as a group
* Communicate your plan to the class (10mins)
