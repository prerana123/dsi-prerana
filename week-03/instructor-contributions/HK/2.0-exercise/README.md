## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

In this exercise we'll be working with [advertising data](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv).

## Exercise

We are interested to find out if there are any linear relationships between the advertising dollars spent on various media and the sale performance of a product. 

To get started, download the [starter code](./w3.2.0_advert-sales_starter.ipynb),
load the data into a Pandas dataframe and explore the variables.

#### Requirements

- Load the dataset with pandas
- Fit simple linear regression models to the data.
- Fit a multiple linear regression model to the data.
- Produce a plot showing how well the model fits by plotting the true values
versus your best model's predictions


#### Starter code

* You can find the [Starter Code here](./w3.2.0_advert-sales_starter.ipynb).
