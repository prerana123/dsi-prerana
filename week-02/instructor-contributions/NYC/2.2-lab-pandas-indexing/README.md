## Introduction
This lab has two parts. First, we're going to combine finding basic math stats using pandas and using Boolean indexing.

Second, you're going to use Boolean indexing to explore the Star Wars survey dataset. This time, you're going to make a hypothesis about subsets of the data, and use the selections you make in Pandas to find evidence for that hypothesis.



#### Requirements

- **Part One:** Use the dataframe provided in the starter code and:
    - select the preTestScore column
    - find the standard deviation of preTestScore
    - select rows in preTestScore with scores greater than the mean
    - create a new column that shows the score change from preTestScore to postTestScore

- **Part Two:** Load the Star Wars dataset into the second starter code notebook:
    - Make a hypothesis about the data that involves intersections between responses
    - Support your hypothesis (in part) by using boolean indexing to take subsets of the data

#### Starter code
