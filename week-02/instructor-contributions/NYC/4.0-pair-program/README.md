Good morning! For today's morning exercise, you're going to partner up to write a function that does the following:

 ` Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
 ``


 For example, the numbers 8-15 look like:
 ...
 8
 Fizz
 9
 Buzz
 11
 Fizz
 13
 14
 FizzBuzz
 ...

 This is a simple example of the type of question you'll see on a programming interview. It's designed to test your grasp of conditionals, loops and programming fundamentals.

 Here's your randomly generated partner for this assignment:
 ```bash
 ('Lydia', 'Tim')

('Kelly', 'Tamara')

('Katty', 'Hudson')

('Tucker', 'Peter')

('Phillippa', 'Sam')

('Michael', 'Rebecca')
```

### 1. Minimum requirement
Open a jupyter notebook. Write a function fizzbuzz() that takes one parameter, n, that operates on the numbers 1-n

### 2. Recommended requirement
Open your text editor. Write a program, fizzbuzz.py that will run from the command line, prompt the user for n.

When you've finished, send fizzbuzz.py in a snippet to the class slack channel.

### 3. Bonus requirement
Back in the Jupyter notebook, create a DataFrame with one column, nums, that has the values 0-100.

Create a new column with the FizzBuzz outputs using .apply(), then again using .applymap()

### 4. Bonus /# 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

`1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...``

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
