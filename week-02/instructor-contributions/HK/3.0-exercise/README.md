Week 2 | Exercise 3.0

Obtain the [Sleep alone dataset](./assets/dataset/sleeping-alone-data.csv), which contains a survey about couples who sleep alone.
Please find out more about the study and get the data ready so you can visualise some information about it.

You can also load it directly using the following link:

In Jupyter complete the following tasks:

1. Load the data set

2. Look at the data, is there anything that needs to be modified?

3. Look at the sleep alone question:
  - How many response types are there?
  - What is the distribution of responses?

4. Look at the age of the respondents:
  - How many response types are there?
  - What is the distribution of responses?

5. Household Income
  - How many response types are there?
  - What is the distribution of responses?

6. Any difference between people who "Never" slept alone and people who sleeps alone "Every night"?
  - In relation to Age
  - In relation to Income

7. Can you estimate the age of every person in the dataset?
  - Make whatever assumption you need to get this done easily
  - What is the mean age for people who "Never" slept alone and people who sleeps alone "Every night"?


9. Can you add a column estimating the income for every person in the dataset?
  - Make whatever assumption you need to get this done easily
  - What is the mean income for people who "Never" slept alone and people who sleeps alone "Every night"?
