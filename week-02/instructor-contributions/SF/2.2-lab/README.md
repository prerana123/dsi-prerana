## Introduction
In this lab we're going to combine finding basic math stats using pandas and using Boolean indexing. 

#### Requirements

- Use the dataframe provided and: 
    - select the preTestScore column
    - find the standard deviation of preTestScore 
    - select rows in preTestScore with scores greater than the mean
    - create a new column that shows the score change from preTestScore to postTestScore
    
**Bonus:**
- Use the same dataframe provided above
    - find the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the ages of the students
- Create another small dataframe of your own
    - do all of the requirements above

#### Starter code

Here's a few sentences explaining any started code that's included in the `starter-code` folder.
