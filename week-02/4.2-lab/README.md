## Introduction
SciPy is a collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on the Numpy extension of Python. It adds significant power to the interactive Python session by providing the user with high-level commands and classes for manipulating and visualizing data.

Scipy is built on top of Numpy and uses Numpy arrays and data types. Hence we can use all the array manipulation and indexing methods provided by Numpy. Scipy imports all functions in the Numpy package, and several commonly used functions from sub-packages, into the top level namespace. For example, the Numpy array function is available as scipy.array. Similarly, the function `scipy.var` is the same as `numpy.var`. This means that we donâ€™t have to *explicitly* import Numpy.

Note: Both libraries are installed from the current version of Anaconda.

### Random number generation

A random number generator (RNG) is a computational or physical device designed to generate a sequence of numbers or symbols that can not be reasonably predicted better than by a random chance. Various applications of randomness have led to the development of several different methods for generating random data, of which some have existed since ancient times, including dice, coin flipping, and other techniques. 

Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large numbers of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required a lot of work and/or time. Nowadays, there are computational random-number generators.

Computational algorithms can produce long sequences of apparently random results, which are in fact completely determined by a shorter initial value, known as a seed value or key. As a result, the entire seemingly random sequence can be reproduced if the seed value is known. This type of random number generator is often called a *pseudorandom number generator*.

Why would we want to create random numbers via a a pseudorandom number generator? In order to simulate
a real world situation when:

- It is not possible to observe the behavior directly or to conduct experiments.
- Chance plays a part in the data.
- The system that we need to test does not exist yet. For example, it would be too expensive to create a system that we need to study

Scipy has two general distribution classes for generating random numbers: *continuous random variables* and *discrete random variables*. Over 80 continuous random variables (RVs) and 10 discrete random variables have been implemented. 

In this lab, we are going to focus on random variates (rvs), a normal distribution, and some summary stats! To generate a sequence of random variates, use the size keyword argument:

```Python
import scipy as sp
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats
from scipy.stats import norm
```

And then:

```Python
random = norm.rvs(size=3)
```

In the example above, the specific stream of random numbers is not reproducible across runs. To achieve *reproducibility*, you can explicitly *seed a global variable*:

```Python
random = np.random.seed(1234)
```

Relying on a global state is not recommended though.

**Check:** Why do you think a global seed variable might be a bad idea?

A better way is to use the *random_state parameter* which accepts an instance of `numpy.random.RandomState class`,
or an integer which is then itself used to seed an internal `RandomState` object:

> Note: You may wish to diagram this relationship on the whiteboard to clarify.

```Python
random = norm.rvs(size=5, random_state=1234)
```

**Check** Why is it important to make something reproducible?

The `scipy.stats` sub package has a `describe` function that will provide the number of elements, min, max, variance, skew, and kurtosis. Let's take a look:

```Python
n, min_max, mean, var, skew, kurt = stats.describe(s)
print("Number of elements: {0:d}".format(n))
print("Minimum: {0:8.6f} Maximum: {1:8.6f}".format(min_max[0], min_max[1]))
print("Mean: {0:8.6f}".format(mean))
print("Variance: {0:8.6f}".format(var))
print("Skew : {0:8.6f}".format(skew))
print("Kurtosis: {0:8.6f}".format(kurt))
```

Remember, _skewness_ quantifies how symmetrical the distribution is. _Kurtosis_ quantifies whether the shape of the data distribution matches the Gaussian distribution. 

A Gaussian distribution has a kurtosis of 0. A flatter distribution has a negative kurtosis, whereas a more peaked distribution has a positive kurtosis.

Ok! Now that you have some background, here is your lab assignment:

#### Requirements
- Create a reproducible data set of random numbers
- Find the number of elements, min, max, variance, skew, and kurtosis
- Explain what the skew and kurtosis mean. Is it skewed left? right? Does the kurtosis mean the
  distribution is flatter? more peaked?
- Reproducibility: have a partner generate the same set of random numbers you did. Do they get
  the same results?

**Bonus:**
- Do your random numbers follow a normal distribution? If not, how would you create simulated
  normal distribution?
