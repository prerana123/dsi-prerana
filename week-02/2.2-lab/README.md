## Introduction
In this lab, we're going to combine finding basic math stats using pandas and using Boolean indexing.

#### Requirements

- Use the dataframe provided in the starter code and:
    - select the preTestScore column
    - find the standard deviation of preTestScore
    - select rows in preTestScore with scores greater than the mean
    - create a new column that shows the score change from preTestScore to postTestScore

**Bonus:**
- Use the same dataframe provided from the starter code, and:
    - find the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the ages of the students
- Create another small dataframe of your own
    - do all of the requirements above

#### Starter code

[Here is the starter code](./code/starter-code/w2-2.2-starter.ipynb).
