Data Science Immersive | Project 5	 						

Your project will be assessed using the following standards, [derived from the data science workflow](../../../../resources/syllabus/DSI-workflow-v1.pdf):

- [ ] Identify Problem
- [ ] Acquire Data
- [ ] Parse Data
- [ ] Mine Data
- [ ] Refine Data		
- [ ] Model Data
- [ ] Present Results

Acceptable performance for these standards is based on how well you've performed the specific requirements listed below.

### Performance Evaluation
> Instructors: Mark boxes with 'X' or "n/a" if a section does not apply. Note that "Exceeds Expectations" (3pts) is really only applicable for student writeups or specially marked "*Bonus*" Options.

| Requirements | Incomplete (0) | Does Not Meet Expectations (1) | Meets Expectations (2) | Exceeds Expectations (3) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Identify: Describe goals, risks & assumptions | | | | n/a |
| Acquire: Pull remote data; load locally | | | | n/a |
| Parse: Query & sort your data | | | | n/a |
| Mine: EDA & Data Description  | | | | n/a |
| Refine: Data Wrangling  | | | | n/a |
| Model: Logistic Regression & Model Validation | | | | n/a |
| Model: kNN & Model Validation | | | | n/a |
| Model: Gridsearch optimal parameters for logistic regression and kNN | | | | n/a |
| Present: Create report with findings, accuracy, assumptions, based on your audience | | | | |
| *Bonus! Change classifier decision threshold for positive labels* | | | | |
| *Bonus! Examine precision-recall instead of accuracy/ROC* | | | | |
| *Bonus! Present: Create blog post summary* | | | | |
| *Very Bonus! Model with decision trees and bagging classifiers* | | | | |
